Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropri - ately. The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. In the general population younger than 60 years, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. The target systolic pressure in this population is less than 140 mm Hg, and the target diastolic pressure is less than 90 mm Hg. Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or diabetes melli - tus, the treatment threshold and tar - get blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years (i.e., threshold systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or threshold diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg; target systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg; target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg). There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension. Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti - hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treat - ment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a JNC 8 Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in AdultsPractice Guidelines Key Points for Practice \u2022 In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is", "150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years. \u2022 In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age. \u2022 Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population. \u2022 If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

Practice Guidelines504 American Family Physician www.aafp.org/afp Volume 90, Number 7 \u25c6 October 1, 2014second medication should be added (thia - zide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB; do not combine an ACE inhibitor with an ARB). Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regi - men adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached. A third drug should be added if necessary; however, if the target blood pres - sure cannot be achieved using only the drug classes listed above, antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used (e.g., beta blockers, aldosterone antagonists). Refer - ral to a physician with expertise in treating hypertension may be necessary for patients who do not reach the target blood pressure using these strategies. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moder - ate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization was established in 2003 with the mission toimprove the care and outcomes of people living with kidneydisease worldwide. The development and implementation ofglobal clinical practice guidelines is central to the many ac- tivities of KDIGO to ful \ufb01ll its mission. Twenty years later, we are excited to present this update of the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to complement the existing 12 guidelines that address various other facets of kidneydisease management. Our aspiration is that the KDIGO CKD Guideline serves as a comprehensive reference for evidence-based practices, of- fering clear and valuable guidance for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of CKD. The updated guideline is the result ofa rigorous process, extensively detailed in the KDIGOMethods Manual. To promote objectivity and transparency,we screen Guideline Co-Chairs and Work Group members(which include clinicians, researchers, and patients) for con-\ufb02icts of interest. Over a span of 2 \u20133 years, these individuals volunteer their time, starting with the creation of a Scope of Work that undergoes an open public review to engage all stakeholders. This document is then adapted into a Requestfor", "Proposal, which is used to enlist an independent EvidenceReview Team. The Evidence Review Team conducts a systematic review of existing literature, extracting studies with appropriate designand outcomes deemed important by both people with CKDand clinicians. All work is meticulously graded on study quality and potential bias, forming the basis for quantifying the overall certainty of the evidence using the \u201cGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalua-tion\u201d(GRADE) approach. The penultimate version of the guideline also undergoes public review to capture additionalperspectives. Thus, guidelines are the result of a rigorous andobjective assessment of available evidence, enriched by thecollective expertise of healthcare providers, researchers, and patients alike. Guideline statements (\u201cWe recommend \u201dor \u201cWe suggest \u201d)r e\ufb02ect clinical questions that were addressed bythe evidence reviews from the Evidence Review Team. Practice points provide guidance on clinical questions that were not,and largely could not be, studied by the Evidence ReviewTeam. We view the current guideline as a dynamic, evolving resource rather than a static document. We are delighted by therecent pace of clinical discovery that substantially increased thescienti \ufb01c basis of optimal CKD diagnosis and management, and we remain committed to updating recommendations andpractice points as important evidence emerges. We hope thatthe guideline will serve as a useful tool for clinicians in theirdaily practice, providing clear insight into the evidence-basedrecommendations while highlighting areas requiring further research. Ultimately, our aim is to facilitate more effective and consistent care to patients with CKD worldwide, and thepublication of the CKD Guideline will provide the foundationof many dissemination and implementation activities to in-crease the outreach and usefulness of this work. We extend our heartfelt gratitude for all those who have contributed to the CKD Guideline. First, to the members ofthe Methods Committee, particularly Dr. Marcello Tonelli, MD, SM, MSc, Chair of the Committee, and Amy Earley, BS, KDIGO Guideline Development Director, for setting theexpectation of rigor, balance, and transparency throughoutthe process. Next, to the Evidence Review Team at JohnsHopkins University, for their meticulous work in reviewingthe existing literature. Third, to the Work Group members,led by the indefatigable Drs. Adeera Levin, MD, and PaulStevens, MB, for their diligence and innumerable hours vol- unteered to shepherd the guideline to publication. Fourth, to the many individuals who provided comments during therounds of public review. Finally, to the whole KDIGO staff,for their steadfast, behind the scenes commitment to excel-lence in patient care. Sincerely, Morgan E.

The aim is to assist clinicians caring for people with CKD, bothadults and children. People receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients are not the focus ofthis guideline. The scope includes chapters dedicated to the evaluation of CKD, risk assessment inpeople with CKD, management to delay CKD progression and manage its complications, medicalmanagement and drug stewardship in CKD, and optimal models of CKD care. In addition, this guideline includes a comprehensive introduction from the guideline Co-Chairs, a patient foreword, a discussion of special population considerations, a presentation of the relative andabsolute risks associated with speci \ufb01c outcomes from the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD- PC), and an extensive section dedicated to research recommendations based on the current gapsin evidence. The goal of the guideline is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients byproviding actionable recommendations based on a rigorous formal evidence review, practicepoints that serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematic review was not con-ducted,", "and useful infographics. The guideline targets a broad audience of healthcare providers involved in the care of people with CKD as well as people with CKD themselves while being mindful of implications for policy and payment. Development of this guideline update followedan explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline rec-ommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the certaintyof the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the \u201cGrading of Recommenda- tions Assessment, Development, and Evaluation \u201d(GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evi- dence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.

KDIGO 2024 Clinical Practice Guideline forthe Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Kidney Int. 2024;105(4S): S117\u2013S314.www.kidney-international.org abstract Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S133 Patient foreword The identi \ufb01cation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) begins a long journey for any patient that will have a direct impact on their lifestyle and future health outcomes. This guidelineidenti \ufb01es the suitability of medical interventions that can improve or delay the seriousness of CKD and possible kidneyfailure. In a complicated world of health provision, having a set of evidential recommendations and practice points provideskidney service providers with the targets for a quality CKDservice for people with kidney disease. However, if the startingpoint for many people is ignorance of what a kidney actuallydoes, then without a holistic approach to patient care, much ofthe potential effectiveness of medical interventions can bediluted because of patient circumstances and psychologicalchallenges. Acceptance of the seriousness of CKD can take a lot longer for a person to process, to the possible detriment ofmedical intervention, and may well lead to issues over adherence. A controlled, managed CKD decline is so bene \ufb01cial to patients who have so many social issues to contend with, be it diet, tiredness, liquid control, pill overload, and a deep diveinto the very mechanics of how we eat and drink to surviveand excrete excesses. In an ever-increasingly busy world of medical care, as pa- tients, we believe that the best approach is for any physician to aim to achieve a partnership of knowledge with the patient regarding their CKD care. This will build patient con \ufb01dence and self-awareness, with the aim that any patient who sadly arrives atpossible dialysis is in the right state of mind, which is critical for aconsidered approach to the next stage of a patient \u2019s journey. Guy Hill CKD Work Group Memberpatient foreword www.kidney-international.org S134 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Introduction, qualifying statements, and key concepts This 2024 update of the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-ease (CKD) 1is an evidence-based guideline that provides recommendations and practice points for clinicalmanagement activities. The past 10 years have provided new hope for improved treatment of CKD. A greater understanding of healthy lifestyleand lifestyle modi", "\ufb01cations together with new medications and technologies furnish improved options for treatment andmonitoring of CKD. People with CKD, healthcare providers,and health systems are eager to implement these advances in the most effective and evidence-based manner. This requires integration of new therapies with lifestyle management andexisting medications using approaches that engage patientsand optimize application of health resources. The goal of thisguideline document is to provide such guidance. The majorityof statements from the 2012 guideline have been updatedbased on current knowledge and practice. Only 6 statementswere retained in their original form in 2012. As Co-Chairs, we would like to recognize the outstanding efforts of the Work Group, the Evidence Review Team (ERT),and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)staff. The Work Group was diverse, multinational, multidis-ciplinary, experienced, thoughtful, and dedicated. Notably,the Work Group included 2 members who have CKD whocontributed actively as peers to keep the guideline relevantand patient-centered. We are indebted to each and every in- dividual who contributed to this process. We hope that the guidance provided here will help improve the care of peoplewith CKD worldwide. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was built on the United States (US)-based Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative(KDOQI) 2002 Guideline on De \ufb01nition, Classi \ufb01cation, and Evaluation of CKD, 2accepted by the international community in 2005. It reinforced the de \ufb01nition of CKD incorporating a persistent reduction in glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage and modi \ufb01ed the staging and classi \ufb01cation system to include elements that had begun to be appreciated by the clinical community.3 Speci \ufb01cally, the 2012 guideline introduced the concept of a \u201cCGA\u201dclassi \ufb01cation of CKD based on cause (C), level of kidney function determined by GFR (G), and degree ofalbuminuria (A). The CGA classi \ufb01cation laid a foundation upon which management, treatment, research, and riskassessment of CKD have since been based. The de \ufb01nition, staging, and classi \ufb01cation of CKD pro- posed by the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline have been widelyaccepted and implemented worldwide. Research has sincehighlighted that higher speci \ufb01c stages or categories of CKD, characterized by level of GFR and albuminuria independently,portend greater relative risk (RR) for adverse outcomes. 4\u20137 These include, but are not limited to, CKD progression,cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality (all-cause and car-diovascular), kidney failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI).The development of risk-prediction tools has re \ufb01ned moni- toring and referral to specialist nephrology and has aided inthe estimation of prognosis. 6,8\u201310Although there remains ongoing discussion about application of the same thresholdsto de \ufb01ne disease in older adults, 11it is still clear that even in older populations, risk of adverse outcomes increaseswith higher CKD stages (Figure 1 ). 12In any \ufb01eld of medicine, although data from large population studiesinform clinical practice guidelines and associated recommendations for care, it is critically important to consider the individual in front of you, their preferences,and their individual risks and bene \ufb01ts. We recognize that the threshold GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(GFR categories G3a \u2013G5) for >3 months to indicate a diagnosis of CKD is well", "below the average in young adult men andwomen, 13but because a signi \ufb01cant GFR reduction in younger people is also usually associated with other markers of kidney disease, the diagnosis of CKD would be captured. Similarly, we recognize that there is an average age-associated GFR decline observed in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, 14but with substantial variation among individuals within the population,15such that not all individuals will have a signi \ufb01cant GFR decline with age.12 This guideline is not intended to be a textbook, and thus statements regarding prevention and screening for CKD, although important topics, are not addressed in depth but are brie\ufb02y discussed below in the context of the global burden of CKD and in Chapter 1. For a more detailed discussion of theseissues, we refer readers to existing textbooks and reviews. 16\u201318 Prevention and screening for CKD should be conductedmostly by healthcare providers in primary care and in otherspecialties, such as endocrinology, cardiology, and oncology,rather than restricted to nephrologists. We strongly support efforts aimed at the early detection and treatment of CKD among people at high risk for CKD, including those withhypertension, diabetes, and CVD. Screening efforts in theseand other populations should include assessments of GFR(estimated or in certain situations measured [see Section 1.2] and albuminuria [or surrogate, see Section 1.3]). The intended starting point for this update of the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline is an established diagnosis of CKD, though there are some practice points to clarify the evaluation of CKD and the ascertainment of chronicity. The care ofpeople with CKD is multifaceted and complex. Several criticalaspects of this comprehensive care, such as blood pressure(BP), diabetes, and lipid management, have been addressed inother KDIGO guidelines. These topics were not reviewed forthe current guideline, but recommendations have beenincorporated where relevant and we refer readers to those speci\ufb01c KDIGO guidelines and their updates. 19\u201323www.kidney-international.org introduction, qualifying st atements, and key concepts Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S135 This clinical practice guideline includes 2 different types of statements: graded recommendations, which are supported by systematic reviews (i.e., de novo reviews conducted by the in- dependent ERTor existing high-quality reviews that have beensystematically identi \ufb01ed), and ungraded practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematicreview was not conducted for various reasons (e.g., lack of asuf\ufb01cient evidence base or randomized controlled trials [RCTs] would be impractical/unethical). Both recommenda-tions and practice points are intended to help guide clinicalpractice and aid in decision-making; thus, they collectively arethe guidance statements. They are clearly articulated andpresented together so that all guideline statements can be implemented. The distinction between them is based on the process by which they are derived, that process is based on theframework methodology from the KDIGO Methods Com-mittee and aligns with other international guideline groupsutilizing the \u201cGrading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation \u201d(GRADE) methodology. Several exciting developments have been introduced into clinical practice since the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline waspublished. These include re \ufb01nement of evaluation of GFR, population and individual risk prediction, and", "novel treat-ments which have all positively in \ufb02uenced the prognosis for people with CKD. The Work Group has aimed to generate aguideline that is both rigorously devoted to new and existing evidence, and clinically useful. Research recommendations are presented in a separate section at the end of this document and are intended to guide the next set of important research questions to inform andimprove outcomes of people living with CKD. The researchrecommendations are not exhaustive but are intended to helpfocus the clinical and research communities on unansweredquestions including improving diagnostic tools and evalua- tion of kidney function, development and testing of risk prediction equations in clinical and research settings, evalu-ation of different therapies to delay progression in variouscombinations, improved medication management, andoptimal models of care.

CKD is de \ufb01ned as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months, with implications for health ( Table 1 ).1 Classifying CKD. CKD is classi \ufb01ed based on Cause, GFR category (G1 \u2013G5), and Albuminuria category (A1 \u2013A3), abbreviated as CGA .1These 3 components of the classi \ufb01cation system are each critical in the assessment of people with CKD and help enable determination of severityand risk. Listed below are reference tables describing eachcomponent. Note that while the de \ufb01nition of CKD includes many different markers of kidney damage and is notcon\ufb01ned to decreased GFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g [> 3 mg/mmol], the classi \ufb01cation system is based on the 2 dimensions of GFR and degree of albuminuria ( Tables 2 and 3). This nuance is often missed by healthcare providers and students. It is well established that patient advocates with CKD and healthcare providers prefer the more clinically useful and generally understood assessment of GFR resulting from theuse of GFR estimating equations compared with serumcreatinine (SCr) alone. Globally, although still not universallyavailable in all countries, SCr is measured routinely and the approach to assessment of GFR is therefore to use SCr and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. Theapproach to evaluation of GFR using initial and supportivetests is described in greater detail in Chapter 1. Etiology of CKD should be sought, and there are numerous systems for grouping various etiologies, some ofwhich are evolving with new knowledge and diagnostic tools.There are congenital and genetic causes of CKD, some asso- ciated with systemic diseases, and others that are primary. It is beyond our remit to suggest a speci \ufb01c approach, but we highlight the importance of establishing a cause to individ-ualize management of CKD. The global burden of CKD The", "Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk FactorsStudy (GBD) pulls together data on premature death anddisability from more than 350 diseases and injuries in 204 countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present. 24Disease \u201cburden \u201dis the impact of a health problem as measured by\ufb01nancial cost, mortality, morbidity, or other indicators and can be measured by combining 2 indicators to describe thedisability-adjusted life-years (DALYs): the number of yearsof life lost to disease and the number of years lived withdisability due to disease. Globally, in 2017, a systematic analysis from the all-age GBD project found 697.5 million (95% uncertainty interval[UI]: 649.2 \u2013752.0) cases of all-stage CKD, for a global preva- lence of 9.1% (8.5% \u20139.8%). 25By 2021, a joint statement from the American Society of Nephrology, European RenalAssociation, and International Society of Nephrologyindicated that more than 850 million people suffer fromsome form of kidney disease, roughly double the number ofpeople who live with diabetes (422 million) and 20 times more than the prevalence of cancer worldwide (42 million) or people living with AIDS/HIV (36.7 million). Theseestimates derive from aggregation of studies worldwide,which have applied a variety of de \ufb01nitions of CKD; nevertheless, they furnish the best guide about global CKDprevalence. In 2017, CKD was estimated to account for 35.8 million (95% UI: 33.7 e38.0) DALYs, and 1.2 million people died from CKD. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated inthe 3 lowest quintiles of sociodemographic index (SDI). In2019, CKD was responsible for 41.5 million (95% UI: 38.3 \u2013 45.0) DALYs, and 1.43 million people died from CKD. 24Age- standardized DALY rates (Figure 224) were highest in central and Andean Latin America, at 1348.1 (1203.6 \u20131521.6) and 836.3 (704.2 \u2013981.6) per 100,000, respectively (global rate was 514.9 [474.9 \u2013558.9]). In 2017, CKD in diabetes represented a third of all DALYs, and there were 1.4 millionTable 1 | Criteria for chronic kidney disease (either of the following present for a minimum of 3 months) Markers of kidney damage (1 or more)Albuminuria (ACR $30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol]) Urine sediment abnormalitiesPersistent hematuriaElectrolyte and other abnormalities due totubular disordersAbnormalities detected by histologyStructural abnormalities detected by imagingHistory of kidney transplantation Decreased GFR GFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (GFR categories G3a \u2013G5) ACR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.Table 2 | GFR categories in CKD GFRcategoryGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m 2) Terms G1 $90 Normal or high G2 60\u201389 Mildly decreaseda G3a 45\u201359 Mildly to moderately decreased G3b 30\u201344 Moderately to severely decreased G4 15\u201329 Severely decreased G5 <15 Kidney failure CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate. aRelative to the young adult level.

Overall, CKD and its effect on CVD resulted in 2.6 million (95% UI: 2.4 \u20132.8) deaths in 2017 and CKD has risen from 19th to 11th in rank amongleading causes of death between 1990 and 2019 due toaging and an increasing burden of risk factors for CKD(including diabetes and hypertension) that, together,contribute to more than half of the deaths from CKD. Screening and prevention Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD,there remains controversy and lack of consensus as to the utility of population screening for CKD 26or targeted screening programs,18due to the complexity of the underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public health policy has a role to play in identifying andaddressing risk factors to prevent CKD, to identify CKDearly, and to delay its progression and associated adverseoutcomes. Education of both health personnel and thepopulations at risk, implementation of early kidney disease detection programs, and incorporation of evidence-based treatment of CKD and its associated conditions, such as BPand diabetes, are all essential components of a strategy toaddress this burden. A systematic review suggested thatscreening for CKD is cost- effective in people with diabetes and hypertension, the 2 most common causes of CKDworldwide. 16However, clinical trials have not been conducted to determine whether or not an intervention to detect, risk -stratify, and treat CKD would improve the health outcomes for the targeted population. Nevertheless, cost-effective analysis of population -wide screening for CKD incorporating evidence -based treatment with sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) recently concluded that screening adults for albuminuria to identifyCKD could be cost -effective in the United States. 27 This evidence aligns with the KDIGO Controversies Con- ference on Early Detection and Intervention in CKD, whichconcluded that early identi \ufb01cation of CKD in people at risk, who are usually asymptomatic, would likely be bene \ufb01cial in the community and primary care settings if the programs areinterwoven with risk strati \ufb01cation and treatment. 17A community program must be able to provide treatment tothe high-risk group of patients with newly detected CKD tojustify systematic early detection strategies. An additionalconclusion was that screening and treatment programs forCKD should be implemented based on risk strati \ufb01cation to prioritize people, particularly in settings with limitedeconomic resources. Although globally people withhypertension, diabetes, or CVD are at high risk for CKD, other high-risk people may be identi \ufb01ed through genetic risk factors or by varying exposure to environmental pollution, pesticides, water, and nephrotoxic medications includingsigni\ufb01cant analgesic use and herbal medications, depending on geographical region. Frameworks in which to considerspeci\ufb01c regional factors have been offered to facilitate discussion about the value and context of screening for CKD. 26 Currently, kidney disease awareness remains low, and worldwide only 6% of the general population and 10% of thehigh-risk population are aware of their CKD status. Impor-tant to", "note is that patient advocates with CKD strongly arguefor earlier CKD screening and diagnosis. 17They also advocate for CKD detection to be integrated with patient and familyeducation and engagement to improve accessing appropriatehealthcare and knowledge and adherence to recommendedlifestyle modi \ufb01cation and medications. 05001000150020002500 0 1 02 03 04 0 6 07 08 09 0 0 0 1 0 5 SDIDALY rate (per 100,000) Latin America and CaribbeanCentral Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia Sub-Saharan AfricaHigh income North Africa and Middle EastSouth Asia Southeast Asia, east Asia, and OceaniaGBD super-region Figure 2 | Age-standardized chronic kidney disease disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates for each location by sociodemographic index (SDI), both sexes combined, 2019.

For type 1 diabetes (T1D), screening is recommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. The overall costs of a screening program are largely driven by the frequency ofrepeat screening, so the timing of repeated testing should beguided by CKD risk. There are risk equations available toestimate the interval risk of developing CKD, and this riskstrati\ufb01cation could guide repeat testing intervals. 30International considerations In low- and middle-income regions of the world and in thelower sociodemographic quintiles, there is a large gap betweenCKD burden and provision of adequate healthcare. There islimited access to kidney replacement therapy (KRT) combinedwith the rising prevalence of diabetes and hypertension andevidence of substantial sex and gender disparities in access to CKD treatment. These factors highlight the importance of early identi \ufb01cation and treatment of risk factors in primary care. However, the majority of the world \u2019s population with CKD is in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where there aredisparities in access to laboratory diagnostic services, kidneybiopsy, and imaging services, in availability of appropriatelyskilled healthcare providers and the availability and afford-ability of medications. The International Society of Nephrology survey assessing global kidney healthcare resources reported that fewer than 1 in 4 surveyed countries had facilities availablefor routine measurements of SCr or proteinuria. 31Identify adults at risk for CKD Test for GFR* and ACR \u00b1 other markers of kidney damage\u2020 Test for GFR or ACR if not performed and exclude AKI/AKD AKI/AKD present: follow AKI/AKD guidanceGFR <60 ml/min", "per 1.73 m2 and/or ACR \u226530 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] after 3 months or earlier if evidence of chronicity Measure eGFRcr-cys if not performed and available CKD not present Timing of retesting based on individual characteristics such as risk of progression Stage according to GFR and ACR Establish underlying cause Estimate risk of progression Initiate treatmentGFR \u226560 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and ACR <30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and no other markers of kidney damage presentGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or ACR \u226530 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and/or other markers of kidney damage present Figure 3 | Screening algorithm for diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults.

A systematic review of care models in LMIC found that those supporting primary care providers or allied health workers achieved effectiveness in slowing GFR decline, as opposed tointerventions centered on specialty care alone. 32Where there are resource limitations, it is logical to deploy resources wherethey will be most cost-effective, for example, to higher-risk,preventable stages. Standardization/accuracy of testing tools including assays/equipment The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline built on recommendations made to clinical laboratories in the earlier KDOQI 2002guidance. Clinical laboratories were speci \ufb01cally charged with measuring SCr and serum cystatin C using assays with cali-bration traceable to the international standard referencematerials recommending that, for SCr, there should be minimal bias compared with isotope-dilution mass spec- trometry. 1Recommendations were also made with respect to measurement and reporting of albumin and protein in theurine. Although some of the recommendations havebecome part of routine practice, the effective use of clinicalguidelines and therefore effective patient care, includingaccurate diagnosis and referral prioritization, clinicalresearch, and public health prioritization, require comparability of laboratory results independent of time, place, and measurement procedure. Key to this isestablishing precision and between-laboratory agreementwith traceability to accepted reference standards whereveravailable. Therefore, this guidance document includesstandards for laboratory tests. The InternationalConsortium for Harmonization of Clinical LaboratoryResults (ICHLR) was established to create a", "pathway for harmonization and aid implementation of clinical guidelines recommending the use of laboratory tests in the diagnosisand management of disease, 33ensuring that both reference materials and test methodology are harmonized. TheICHLR aimed to prioritize measurands by medicalimportance and both coordinate and stimulate developmentof technical and regulatory processes to achieveharmonization of those measurands. 34Although this has been achieved for SCr, the current status of other keymeasurands such as cystatin C and urinary albumin is notyet suf \ufb01ciently clear. The foundations for this 2024 guideline have been devel- oped over the last 20 years, galvanizing the collaborative workof researchers, healthcare providers, laboratory physicians,patients, and carers. The current updated guideline documentreinforces methods for accurate diagnosis of CKD and pre- diction, incorporates novel treatment strategies and ap- proaches to managing people living with CKD, and identi \ufb01es further areas for research. Importantly, as the \ufb01eld is rapidly changing, we commit to updating relevant sections of thisdocument as new evidence becomes available, to ensure moretimely updates than have previously been possible.

Thus, enabling a personalized approach, consideringage, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment is critical. At the extremes of age \u2014the very young and the very old\u2014 diagnostic procedures, treatment aims, treatment modalities, and decision-making differ due to dif- ferences in prognosis, treatment options, and prioritization.In young and middle-aged adults, treatment approaches maydiffer due to speci \ufb01c circumstances, such as pregnancy or menopause. Sex (biological attributes) and gender (socio-cultural factors), as well as other important intersectional factors including but not limited to geographical location, socioeconomic status (SES), and race and ethnicity, playimportant roles in kidney health and disease. Here we introduce concepts as to why age, sex, and gender should be considered in the context of diagnosis, treatment,and care planning in people with CKD. In addition, thespeci\ufb01c guideline chapters incorporate statements where special considerations regarding age, sex, and gender are relevant to clinical practice and understanding. Considerations in children and adolescents When the guideline refers to people with CKD, this includes children (people <10 years old) and adolescents (people10\u201319 years old). When there are altered care recommenda- tions and practice points due to the unique needs of childrenor the lack of data to inform recommendations and practicepoints, these considerations are discussed within the Pediatric considerations sections of the guideline. The management of children and adolescents with CKD needs special consideration ( Figure 4 ). Children and adults have different etiologies of CKD. Up to 40% \u201350% of childhood CKD is due to congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract(CAKUT); the younger the CKD population, the greater theproportion with CAKUT as the cause. 35,36CAKUT is characterized by slower progression to kidney failure and a higher likelihood of polyuria than the conditions causing CKD", "in adults. Pediatric CKD has several unique aspects: Delivery of care. Pediatric healthcare providers engage with not only the person with CKD but also their carers and sib-lings. Age-appropriate care and education, understood byboth the child and their carers, is necessary. Holistic consid-eration of the needs and capabilities of the family unit isimportant in ensuring effective CKD care. Engagement with patients and families must change over the course of child- hood from being entirely carer-directed for infants, changingto include the whole family unit in childhood, and thenleaning toward the young person to ensure successful tran-sition to adult-oriented care.

BSA, body surface area.www.kidney-international.org special considerations Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S141 Growth, puberty, and young adulthood. Childhood and adolescence are characterized by physical growth and devel- opment. All CKD care aims to optimize these physiologicalprocesses, which are commonly disrupted by CKD. Puberty isa time of rapid somatic growth with an increase in musclebulk and therefore constitutes a high-risk period for CKDprogression as compromised kidneys may not hypertrophy to adapt to the larger body size. Adolescence and emerging adulthood bring individuation and exploration of sexualityand adult behaviors, and kidney disease care must recognizeand adapt to these changes. Kidney development and long-term assessment of kidney risks. Although nephron formation is complete by 36 weeks of gestation, kidney function continues to develop throughoutearly childhood, with nephron growth and maturation pro- gressing particularly rapidly in the \ufb01rst year of life. An actual increase in GFR over the course of the \ufb01rst 1 \u20132 years of life, and even up to 4 years of age, is expected. A trajectory of increasing GFR in infancy and very early childhood followed by a period ofrelative stability and a subsequent progression in CKD inadolescence or adulthood is common. Given the long life ex-pectancy of children, follow-up plans must take into accountthe risk of late CKD or kidney failure. Healthy children and adolescents should have excellent kidney function, so an esti- mated eGFR under 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(CKD G2 \u2013G5) represents decreased kidney function in these age groups. Earlyassessment and intervention of children with CKD is crucial tomaximize overall health across the lifespan. Neurodevelopment and education. A primary goal of pedi- atric CKD care is to optimize neurodevelopmental gains.CKD can affect development, cognition, school attendance, vocational outcomes, and future", "employment. Mitigating these de \ufb01cits through effective, individualized care is essential to give children with CKD the best possible future. Considerations in older adults Older adults constitute a substantial and steadily growingproportion of people under nephrology and medical careglobally, especially in Western industrialized countries.Longevity in many parts of the world is increasing, and thusthe prevalence of CKD in those people is also increasing. The2022 US Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data reporthighlights that the number of individuals initiating KRT iscontinuously ascending with increasing age. In Taiwan, for example, KRT incidence in those aged 75 \u00fewas 2858 per million population (pmp) compared with 1583 pmp among people aged 65 \u201374 years, 530 pmp among people aged 45 \u201364 years, and 97 pmp among people aged 20 \u201344 years. The pattern is very similar across the globe with the majority ofpeople initiating dialysis over the age of 75, which putsemphasis on a group of people who are not just old, but veryold, and incorporates more and more people over the age of 80. Octo- and nonagenarians often demonstrate distinct patterns of disease complexity. These features include multi-morbidity often accompanied by polypharmacy, frailty,cognitive impairment, and gerontopsychiatric disordersamong others. Often, several of these features coexist espe-cially in older adults with CKD. Implications for aging adults with CKD are important in both diagnosis and treatment. The interpretation of labora- tory results (speci \ufb01cally SCr) used in the staging system should factor in an older adult \u2019s habitus given the frequency of sarcopenia. A creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) will over- estimate GFR in the elderly (and others) with sarcopenialeading to drug overdosing. Urine ACR at the same time willbe falsely high due to the falsely low creatinine in the de-nominator. Furthermore, the presence of frailty may altertreatment targets recommended for younger people with CKD, as they may not necessarily be transferable to older adults. Strict BP-lowering, for example, may come with therisk of dizziness, falls, and fractures in older adults, many ofwhom are on anticoagulants risking severe hemorrhage. The multidimensionality of comorbidities in old age poses challenges, as it demands a sophisticated integrated andcomplex multidisciplinary care and treatment approach,which may not be available in every healthcare system. Life expectancy in old age is naturally limited compared with younger people. Perspectives and treatment goals shift overthe life course, and recognizing these in very old adults, asdifferent from those in middle-aged or younger adults withCKD, is critical to the development of more personalized careplans and goals. Speci \ufb01cally, pure survival may become less of a priority for an older individual, whereas maintaining anacceptable, good quality of life (QoL) may be more impor- tant. The context of a person \u2019s situation and own values and preferences may modify the prioritization for testing, treat- ment types, and treatment goals. For example, the decision-making between KRT and conservative care should be madeon the basis of the person \u2019s priorities, medical needs, and informed decision as to bene \ufb01ts and harms of various op- tions. These informed decisions require good communicationbetween caregivers, people", "with CKD, and their relatives/ carers; they require time, \u201croom, \u201dadequate understandable language, patience, trust, and commitment. Repeated con- versations are critical, given the higher prevalence of cognitivede\ufb01cits in older adults with CKD. These cognitive issues accompany both aging and CKD and frequently remain un-recognized, thus, impeding shared decision-making andadvance care planning in this group. In summary, older adults constitute the largest group among all people with advanced CKD. Although every singleperson needs individual care, the multidimensional medicalcomplexity inherent in very old age is challenging. Wherespeci\ufb01c recommendations or practice points require special consideration in the elderly, we make clear statements in thespecial considerations section and encourage clinicians toindividualize therapies and goals of care in all patients, withspecial attention to those of advanced age. Considerations regarding sex and gender It is increasingly recognized that sex (biological attributes)and gender (sociocultural factors) factors across individualsspecial considerations www.kidney-international.org S142 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 contribute to differences in kidney health and disease.37\u201339 Sex-based variation in genetics, physiology, immunology, and anatomy, as well as gender factors such as identity, roles, andrelations in addition to institutionalized gender, in \ufb02uences kidney disease pathophysiology, presentation, response totherapy, complications, and outcomes, highlighting the needto take these factors into consideration in the care of theperson living with kidney disease. Globally, the prevalence of CKD not being treated with dialysis de \ufb01ned by level of eGFR is greater in women than men. 40Progression of CKD has been reported as more rapid in men,41,42in women,43or no difference by sex or gender.44 These incongruities are likely a re\ufb02 ection of differences in cause of kidney disease and de \ufb01nitions of outcomes (e.g., loss of eGFR or receipt of KRT). There is substantial literature demonstrating that both sex- and gender-related factors (e.g., puberty, menstrual patterns,hormonal contraception, pregnancy and pregnancy-relatedcomplications, menopause, menopausal hormone therapy,testosterone levels, and gender-af \ufb01rming hormone therapy) play important roles in the risk, progression, complications,and treatment of kidney disease. 45 These factors will play prominent roles in progression of kidney disease across different stages of the life cycle. Forexample, the use of some recommended medications has notbeen studied in pregnant populations, highlighting theimportance of contraceptive counseling in accordance with aperson \u2019s values and preferences. In other instances, precon- ception counseling, changing medications to nonteratogenicoptions and a multidisciplinary approach, is required tooptimize the outcomes of a potential pregnancy in the settingof CKD. Sex-based differences in pharmacokinetics andpharmacodynamics that are accentuated with increasing ageand changing hormonal status may alter the response todifferent therapies for the treatment of kidney disease. Forexample, women are more likely to report adverse reactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), 46which play a role in adherence and failure to reach guideline- recommended target doses. There are differences between women and men in the detection, recognition, monitoring, referrals, and manage-ment of CKD. 47,48Although the reasons behind these disparities are unclear, access to kidney care may be limitedby familial and other caregiving responsibilities, as well as \ufb01nancial challenges, occupational obligations, and time constraints, which are in \ufb02uenced by gender identity (how", "an individual self-identi \ufb01es, behaves, expresses their gender,and is perceived by others, e.g., woman, man, girl, boy,and gender-diverse), roles (social expectations and normstypically associated with a given gender, e.g., primaryhousehold earner and caregiver), relations (interactions with and treatment by others based on an individual \u2019s perceived and/or expressed gender identity), and institutionalized gender (e.g., distribution of power andresources in society). 37 A small but increasing proportion of the world \u2019s popula- tion identi \ufb01es as transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary where sex assigned at birth differs from gender identity,highlighting the urgent need to build transgender cultural safety within all aspects of kidney disease management and care. 49 Taking sex and gender considerations into account is critical to optimize the care of the individual with kidneydisease. Although there is increasing literature to inform sex-and gender-speci \ufb01c recommendations in nephrology, signif- icant knowledge gaps remain, underscoring the importance ofa person-centered approach in kidney care. Considerations regarding fertility and pregnancy Neither fertility nor pregnancy in people with CKD was partof the scope of work for this guideline update, but there willbe special consideration relating to fertility and pregnancyrequiring speci \ufb01c reference in relevant sections of the guideline. Fertility. CKD is associated with decreased female and male fertility.50,51Progressively impaired function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis appears to play a keyrole in the pathophysiology, although multiple factorscontribute to the reduction in fertility in this population. Inconjunction with the decreased fertility associated in CKDand the uncertainty of the impact of assisted reproductivetechnologies on kidney function, ongoing discussion offamily planning potential between the person with CKD and their healthcare provider is essential. Pregnancy. People with CKD are at risk for adverse preg- nancy-associated outcomes, including progression of their underlying CKD, a \ufb02are of their kidney disease, and adverse pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, pretermdelivery, and small for gestational age infant. 52,53The severity of CKD is associated with risk of adverse pregnancyoutcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to preconception counseling and management of pregnancy is necessary to achieve optimal outcomes for both the person with CKDand the infant. 54www.kidney-international.org special considerations Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S143 Summary of relative and absolute risks relevant to CKD from meta-analysis of large multinational population studies in the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) Outcomes relevant to CKD, and the prognostic importance of CKD categories The most highly evaluated endpoints in epidemiological studies have been all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure), and kidney-speci\ufb01c outcomes (progression to kidney failure and AKI), although additional outcomes such as all-cause hospitaliza-tion and incident atrial \ufb01brillation have been studied more recently. In this section, we highlight newer data derived fromthe CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC). 12We describe the associations of CKD categories with 10 of these important outcomes and demonstrate the importance of different methods of estimating GFR (i.e., using creatinine-or cystatin C \u2013based equations) on these risk gradients. Healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers should understand the association of CKD parameters (ACRand eGFR) in populations. The overall distributions ofepidemiological risk across CKD categories on a populationlevel are", "presented here. This is not to be confused with the information presented in Chapter 2, where individualized risk assessment tools are described, and those tools can be used toinform clinical and management decisions for individualpeople with CKD. Associations of all complications of CKD are incre- mentally increased with worsened categories of estimatedglomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria: updated data. The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu- ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease introducedthe combined staging by eGFR and albuminuria categories,which were justi \ufb01ed by their associations with CKD complica- tions. 1The combined associations of eGFR and ACR categories were presented as \u201cheatmaps, \u201da color-coded depiction of the associations of increased risk with worsening CKD, foroutcomes of all-cause mortality, kidney failure, AKI, and cardiovascular mortality on a population level. In this section, we provide an update to these CKD heatmaps, which havebeen provided by the CKD-PC. 12 Several changes in the development of these updated heatmaps are important to highlight. (i) They now include several clinical databases that allow a much larger population base, comprising up to 27,503,140people for the analyses of each adverse outcome. (ii) The eGFRcr has been changed to the 2021 CKD Epide- miology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, as thisnewer version no longer includes race as a component. (iii) The number of outcomes has been increased to 10, including 6 that are cardiovascular related, 2 that arekidney speci \ufb01c (kidney failure and AKI), and 2 general outcomes (all-cause mortality and all-causehospitalization). (iv) Additional analyses have been conducted using the 2021 CKD-EPI combined eGFR equation that incorporatesboth creatinine and cystatin C. Although the sample sizefor these subsequent analyses is much smaller (n \u00bc 720,736), it does permit better differentiation of associ-ations of eGFR and risk and allows validation of CKDthresholds across populations. CKD staging by eGFRcr and ACR and association with adverse events Figure 512presents the RRs for all eGFR/ACR combinations for the 10 identi \ufb01ed outcomes. The RRs presented have all been adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (current, former, or never), systolic BP (SBP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,body mass index (BMI), use of antihypertensive medications,and a medical history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial \ufb01brillation, peripheral artery dis- ease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, the RRs can be interpreted as the proportionalelevation in risk for each outcome experienced by people inthat stage of CKD (or non-CKD) compared with people inthe healthiest group. Across all the heatmaps, a consistentcolor scheme is used. The\ufb01gures reveal several common themes and highlight the necessity of having both eGFR and ACR parametersavailable in assessing risk. First, within the CKD popula-t i o n ,t h ea s s o c i a t i o no fr i s kf o ra l l1 0o u t c o m e si n c r e a s e swith higher stages of both eGFR and albuminuria. The\ufb01gures present only the RRs for each speci \ufb01cs t a g ea n dn o", "t the absolute risk of experiencing that outcome for peoplein the risk cell. This distinction between relative and ab-solute risks demonstrates the importance of using indi- vidual risk prediction tools for persons with CKD, a subject of Chapter 2. Although nearly all CKD categories are at substantially elevated risk for most outcomes in Figure 5 , a distinction must be made for people in the eGFRcr CKD G3a category and with thelowest ACR severity ( <10 mg/g [ <1m g / m m o l ] ) .T h i sg r o u pi s portrayed in the lower-risk green color for 7 of the 10 outcomespresented, although they have 3-fold higher adjusted risk of AKI and 13-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with the reference group.

The distinction in these risk relationships was further exploredusing spline analyses to depict the risk relationships ofeGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys with all the 10 complications. Forthe 8 outcomes that are not in \ufb02uenced by changes in creatinine (all except kidney failure and AKI), eGFRcrexhibited a J-shaped association such that risk increasedwith eGFR values over 105 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (Figure 712). In contrast, eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution. Based upon the risk relationships of eGFRcr-cys and ACR categories with all complications, the existing CKD staging is appropriate among both younger and older adults. Some authors have suggested that the GFR threshold for CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2should be raised to 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2for younger adults and lowered to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2for older adults.55In younger adults, the purpose of a higher GFR threshold re \ufb02ects the longer risk horizon for younger people, which could lead to higher lifetime CKD progression risks for a given GFR stage. However, the higher lifetime progression risks in younger adults withGFR 60 \u201389 ml/min per 1.73 m 2can be addressed in their management without changing the de \ufb01nition of CKD.Efforts should be directed at people with higher risk withGFR levels >60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2to prevent the incidence of CKD or further reductions in GFR. Among older adults, the \ufb01ndings of consistently elevated RR for older adults with CKD G3a, A1, as de \ufb01ned by eGFRcr- cys, support the inclusion of this large group in the CKD population. These elevated RRs tell us how much more likely the outcome is", "compared with the reference group (eGFR 90 \u2013 104 ml/min per 1.73 m2and ACR <10 mg/g [< 1 mg/ mmol]). Crucially, they do not tell us what the overall like-lihood of the outcome, the absolute risk, is. The absolute riskfor important CKD complications is higher among older thanyounger adults at nearly every stage, particularly for CVD,heart failure, and mortality. Therefore, this population is also likely to bene \ufb01t from having their CKD diagnosed, staged, and treated. Rationale for using cystatin C containing equations for CKD staging The rationale for using cystatin C versus SCr, or a combi- nation of both, in eGFR equations is that creatinine, which isdirectly linked to muscle mass, may be misleading at extremes of body habitus, or in speci \ufb01c conditions (spinal cord injuries and sarcopenia), and that cystatin C is impacted by different variables (steroid use, thyroid disease, and cancer).

Very low levels of SCr often represent poor health status, such as frailty or sarcopenia, which limits the production ofcreatinine. This biological feature of creatinine (i.e., relationto muscle mass) has limited its prognostic utility and resultsin reducing the risk associations for eGFRcr 45 \u201360 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and elevating risks for eGFRcr >110 ml/min per1.73 m2. These limitations are not observed when risk is estimated using eGFRcr-cys or cystatin C \u2013based eGFR", "(eGFRcys) (Figure 7 ). When comparing GFR estimates using these 2 \ufb01ltration markers, risk gradients are consistently stronger for mostoutcomes for eGFRcys in comparison with eGFRcr. Therefore,for the purpose of evaluating the association of eGFR withoutcomes (i.e., projecting prognosis for people with CKD), theeGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys can be considered more accurate.relative and absolute risks associated with CKD www.kidney-international.org S148 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Summary of recommendation statements and practice points Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD 1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD 1.1.1 Detection of CKD Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin mea- surement and assessment of glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR). Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests to con \ufb01rm presence of CKD. 1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomer- ular\ufb01ltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin C\u2013based estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B). 1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i) review of past measurements/estimations of GFR; (ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii) imaging \ufb01ndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv) kidney pathological \ufb01ndings such as \ufb01brosis and atrophy; (v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD; (vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the \ufb01nding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at \ufb01rst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators. 1.1.4 Evaluation of causePractice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and envi- ronmental factors, medications, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologic diagnosis ( Figure 8).www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S149 Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause based on resources available ( Table 622,98-100). Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate (2D). 1.2 Evaluation of GFR 1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFRPractice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term \u201cGFR \u201dwhen referring to the speci \ufb01c kidney function of glomerular \ufb01ltration.

Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less accurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making ( Table 8127-142)(1C). Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous \ufb01ltration marker ( Table 9). Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations in both eGFR and measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in \ufb02uence SCr and cystatin C measurements.

The algorithm describes the approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a \ufb01nal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a moreaccurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C \u2013based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR shouldbe measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous \ufb01ltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in musclemass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speci \ufb01c medications. \u2020Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass or very high levels of in \ufb02ammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.\u2021Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion orextrarenal elimination due to the use of speci \ufb01c medications.www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S151 Table 8 | Indications for use of cystatin C Domain Speci \ufb01c clinical condition Cause of decreased accuracy Comments on GFR evaluation Body habitus and changes in muscle massEating disorders127Non-GFR determinants of SCr eGFRcys may be appropriate if no comorbid illness other than reduction in muscle mass.

Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as de \ufb01ned locally [e.g., continent, country, region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children using validated equations that have been developed or validated in comparable populations. 1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria 1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of pref- erence). In all cases, a \ufb01rst void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children. (i)urine ACR, or (ii)reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR with automated reading. If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements: (i)urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), (ii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with automated reading, or (iii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with manual reading. Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods. /C15Con\ufb01rm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory mea- surement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (i.e., quantify the ACR or PCR if initial semiquantitative tests are positive). /C15Con\ufb01rm ACR \u202130 mg/g ( \u20213 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent \ufb01rst morning void in the morning midstream urine sample.

Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a \ufb01rst morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and proteinuria (in descending order of preference): (i)Both urine PCR and urine ACR, (ii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with automated reading, or (iii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and for albumin with manual reading. 1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure accuracy and reliability of the \ufb01ndings when assessing urine samples. Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creati- nine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferred practice for laboratories. 1.4 Point-of-care testing Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of-care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine and urine albumin measurement where access to a laboratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of-care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creat inine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the same pre- analytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteria relating to the specimen collection and perfor- mance of the device, including external quality asses sment, and the interpretation of the result is used. Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use the equation consistent with that used within the region. Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices toproduce a positive result in 85% of people with signi \ufb01cant albuminuria (ACR \u202130 mg/g or \u20213 mg/ mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device. Chapter 2: Risk assessment in people with CKD 2.1 Overview on monitoring for progression of CKD based upon GFR and ACR categories Practice Point 2.1.1: Assess albuminuria in adults, or albuminuria/proteinuria in children, and GFR at least annually in people with CKD. Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more o ften for individuals at higher risk of CKD progression when measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of >30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation.Table 17 | Implementation standards to ensure", "accuracy and reliability of urine samples /C15Samples for albumin measurement analyzed fresh or stored at 4/C14C for up to 7 days /C15Samples for albumin measurement should not be stored frozen at /C020/C14C /C15Report ACR in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone /C15Reporting to 1 decimal place for ACR whether mg/mmol or mg/g /C15Analytical CV of methods to measure urine albumin should be <15%.

Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% \u20135% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of >40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5, may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1 \u2013G2. Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speci \ufb01c, externally validated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). 2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with CKD Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use externally validated models that are either de veloped within CKD populations or that incor- porate eGFR and albuminuria. Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validated models that predict all-cause mortality speci \ufb01cally developed in the CKD population. Chapter 3: Delaying CKD progression and managing its complications 3.1 CKD treatment and risk modi \ufb01cation Practice Point 3.1.1: Treat people with CKD with a comprehe nsive treatment strategy to reduce risks of progression of CKD and its associated complications ( Figure 17 ). 3.2 Lifestyle factors Practice Point 3.2.1: Encourage people with CKD to under take physical activity compatible with cardiovascular health, tolerance, and level of frailty; achieve an optimal body mass index (BMI); and not to use tobacco products. Referral to providers and progr ams (e.g., psychologists, renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapy, and smoking cessation programs) should be offered where indicated and available. 3.2.1 Avoiding use of tobacco products [No speci \ufb01c recommendations or practice points]Impact on CKD pathophysiology CKD manifestations Prevention and treatment of clinical symptoms and signs (including blood pressure) Maximize", "health-related quality of life, physical function, capacity to work, and ability to socialize Appropriate monitoring and treatment of laboratory abnormalities of CKD associated with implications for health (e.g., anemia, CKD-MBD, potassium disorders, acidosis)\u2022 \u2022\u2022CKD outcomes Minimize risk of progression to kidney failure Manage risk and appropriate treatment of complications, including cardiovascular diseases, hospitalization, gout, infections, etc. \u2022 \u2022 Modification of the natural course of CKD and its symptoms Figure 17 | Chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment and risk modi \ufb01cation.

We draw attention to the following statements: Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that people with CKD be advised to undertake moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D). Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical activity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of other comorbidities, and access to resources. Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior. Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensity of physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and the type of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both). Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD to undertake physical activity a iming for World Health Organization (WHO)-advised levels (i.e., \u202160 minutes daily) and to achieve a healthy weight. 3.3 Diet Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about dietary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potassium, and protein intake, tailored to their indi- vidual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions. 3.3.1 Protein intake Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with CKD G3\u2013 G5(2C). Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression. Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, consider prescribing, under close supervision, a very low \u2013protein diet (0.3 \u20130.4 g/kg body weight/d) sup- plemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kg body weight/d). Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low \u2013protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not", "restrict protein intake in children with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The target protein and energy intake in children with CKD G2 \u2013G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth. Older adults. Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlying conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higher protein and calorie dietary targets. 3.3.2 Sodium intake The Work Group concurs with the following recommendation from KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23and the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease .21 Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD (2C).www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S157 Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based Recommended Daily Intake when counseling about sodium intake for children with CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height. 3.4 Blood pressure control The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease , which encourages individualized BP targets and the use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, and other comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and tolerance to treatments.21We highlight the following guidance: Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of \ufb01ce BP measurement (2B). Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and fractures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypotension. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease , and we highlight the following guidance21: Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to \u00a350th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C). Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3 \u20136 months with standardized auscultatory of \ufb01ce BP in children with CKD. Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatory of\ufb01ce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting, of 50th \u201375th percentile for age, sex, and height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptoms of hypotension. 3.5 Glycemic controlPlease refer to the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease for speci \ufb01c recommendations, practice points, and research recommendations. 3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors The Work Group highlights recommendations from the KDIGO 2021", "Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease 21and the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease.23The Work Group considers several recommendations to apply even in the absence of high BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BP guideline toremove this requirement. Key recommendations and practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-con- verting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1 \u2013G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increased albuminuria (G1 \u2013G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD and moderately-to- severely increased albuminuria (G1\u2013 G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B).summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points www.kidney-international.org S158 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve the bene \ufb01ts described because the proven bene \ufb01ts were achieved in trials using these doses. Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2 \u20134 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hy- potension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for speci \ufb01c indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. 3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease , which stated: \u201cWe recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with an SGLT2i (1A). \u201d23However, in the present guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation for adults", "with CKD. We also highlight practice points from the KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management in CKD, which are also relevant for people with CKD without diabetes: Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR \u202120 ml/ min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): /C15eGFR \u202120 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR \u2021200 mg/g ( \u202120 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice points from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .23 Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular bene \ufb01t for adults with T2D, an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A). Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persis tent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies.www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S159 Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults. Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select people with consistently normal serum potassium concen- tration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA ( Figure 26 ). Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene \ufb01ts. Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or refractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in glomerular \ufb01ltration, particularly among people with a low GFR. 3.9 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice point from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .23 Recommendation 3.9.1: In adults with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor treatment,", "or who are unable to use those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B). Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene \ufb01ts. 3.10 Metabolic acidosis Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or \ufb02uid status. 3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD 3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium measurement Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of potassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and mech- anisms that may in \ufb02uence potassium measurement including diurnal and seasonal variation, plasma versus serum samples, and the actions of medications. 3.11.2 Potassium exchange agentsPractice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologic man- agement of nonemergent hyperkalemia. 3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moderate and severe hyperkalemia in adults [No recommendations and practice points]K+ \u22644.8 mmol/l K+ 4.9\u20135.5 mmol/l K+ >5.5 mmol/l \u2022 Initiate finerenone - 10 mg daily if eGFR 25\u201359 ml/min/1.73 m2 - 20 mg daily if eGFR \u226560 ml/min/1.73 m2 \u2022 Monitor K+ at 1 month after initiation and then every 4 months \u2022 Increase dose to 20 mg daily, if on 10 mg daily \u2022 Restart 10 mg daily if previously held for hyperkalemia and K+ now \u22645.0 mmol/l\u2022 Continue finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg \u2022 Monitor K+ every 4 months\u2022 Hold finerenone \u2022 Consider adjustments to diet or concomitant medications to mitigate hyperkalemia \u2022 Recheck K+ \u2022 Consider reinitiation if/when K+ \u22645.0 mmol/l Figure 26 | Serum potassium monitoring during treatment with a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (\ufb01nerenone). Adapted from the protocols of Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO- DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD). The Work Group considersthese potassium thresholds to be conservative, and it may be considered appropriate to continue MRAs in people with potassium of 5.5 \u20136.0 mmol/ l. This algorithm could be used for steroidal MRA. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved initiation of K\u00fe<5.0 mmol/l. This \ufb01gure is guided by trial design and the FDA label and may be different in other countries. Serum creatinine/estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) should be monitored concurrently with serum potassium. Reproduced from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Diabetes WorkGroup.

Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid\u2013 lowering therapy for people with CKD after their \ufb01rst episode of gout (particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serum uric acid concentration is >9 mg/dl [535mmol/l]). Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitors in preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia. Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine or intra-articular/oral glu- cocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-in \ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Dietary approaches. Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventions which may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol, meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D). 3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional speci \ufb01c interventions to modify risk 3.15.1 Lipid managementThe bene \ufb01ts of lowering LDL cholesterol using statin-based therapies on the risk of ASCVD are well established in people with and without CKD. There are clear recommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease . 19The Work Group concurs with all the recommendations in this guideline. In particular, we draw attention to:www.kidney-international.org summary of recommendation sta tements and practice points Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S161 Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged \u202150 years with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a \u2013G5), we recom- mend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A). Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged \u202150 years with CKD and eGFR \u202160 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR cate- gories G1 \u2013G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B). Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18 \u201349 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the following (2A): /C15known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), /C15diabetes mellitus, /C15prior ischemic stroke, or /C15estimated 10-year incidence", "of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction >10% . Practice Point 3.15.1.1: Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool. Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin-based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largest treatment bene \ufb01ts. Practice Point 3.15.1.3: In adults with CKD aged 18 \u201349, a lower (i.e., <10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also be appropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-based therapy.

The cause of the decreased GFRor increased albuminuria may also not be apparent. In the decade since the publication of the previous KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease, 1there have been substantial advances in treatment for CKD of all causes (Chapter 3), targetedtherapies for speci \ufb01c causes of CKD (e.g., KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management ofGlomerular Diseases 22), as well as understanding of and methods to determine the etiology of CKD. All together, these advances have the potential to slow and possibly prevent the progression of kidney disease. Thus, in this section of Chapter1, we emphasize the importance of detecting CKD, andconsiderations for the optimal methods for staging of CKD,and how to establish chronicity and etiology. 1.1.1 Detection of CKD Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronickidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurementand assessment of glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR).Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treat-ments can be initiated earlier in the disease course. Becausetreatments for CKD provide bene \ufb01ts in reducing risk for both CVD and CKD progression, strategies that promote earlydetection of CKD should improve kidney and non \u2013kidney- related outcomes. Even if medical treatments are not available or indicated for an individual, there are recommended lifestyle changes that could be implemented after the diagnosis of CKD(Chapter 3). Interviews with people who have CKD have pro-vided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if theyreceived a diagnosis of CKD. 17Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisionsbeyond initiating treatments speci \ufb01cally for CKD ( Table 4 ). Each of these is considered in greater depth in the subsequent chapters. Finally, if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person mayallow detection in other family members. Thus, initial testingof blood and urine to detect CKD is important, withcon\ufb01rmatory testing if initial \ufb01ndings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. From a societal perspective, early identi \ufb01cation of and intervention for CKD could have a positive impact on health disparities. In many countries, there is a higher incidence of CKD among people with lower SES, and these people are more likelyto progress to kidney failure and have less access to KRT (dialysis Table 4 | Use of GFR and albuminuria Clinical decisionsCurrent level Change in the level of GFR GFR Albuminuria Diagnosis and staging/C15Detection of CKD /C15Evaluation", "for kidney donation/C15Detection of CKD /C15Detection of AKI and AKD /C15Detection of CKD progression Treatment /C15Referral to nephrologists /C15Patient and family education about CKDand bene \ufb01t of lifestyle changes /C15Monitor progression of GFR decline /C15Referral for kidney transplantation /C15Placement of dialysis access /C15Dosage and monitoring for medicationscleared by the kidney /C15Determine safety of diagnostic tests or procedures /C15Eligibility for clinical trials/C15Referral to nephrologists /C15Patient and family education aboutCKD and bene \ufb01t of lifestyle changes /C15Monitor progression of GFR decline /C15Eligibility for clinical trials/C15Treatment of AKI /C15Monitoring drug toxicity /C15Re-evaluate CKD treatmentstrategies Risk assessment /C15Risk of CKD complications /C15Risk for CKD progression /C15Risk of CVD /C15Risk for medication errors /C15Risk for perioperative complications /C15Risk for mortality /C15Fertility and risk of complicationsof pregnancy/C15Risk for CKD progression /C15Risk for CVD /C15Risk for mortality /C15Fertility and risk of complicationsof pregnancy/C15Risk for kidney failure /C15Risk for CVD, HF, and mortality /C15Risk for adverse pregnancyoutcome AKD, acute kidney disease; AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CVD, cardiovascular disease; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; HF, heart failure.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S169 and transplantation).56A public health approach toward CKD detection and treatment could reduce inequities in the burden of kidney failure by slowing the rate of progression and therisk of CVD for everyone. 57 The possible harm of early detection of CKD is that the new diagnosis may cause anxiety in some people, particularlyif the testing is not discussed in advance of the results. Dis-cussions around disease detection are common in the primarycare setting, and shared decision-making is an establishedpractice through which people may agree to the testing,con\ufb01rm that they would like to be tested, and prepare for the range of possible results and their implications. 58\u201360Early detection increases burden and costs associated with physi-cian visits or treatments, and this may not be balanced bysavings from averting adverse outcomes. CKD \ufb01ts the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for an early detection program. 61\u201363Given that chronic disease detection and prevention frameworks have been deployed forother disease and risk factor conditions, in our view, CKDdetection strategies should be implemented for high-risk people. A framework has been developed for communities to align CKD detection and treatment strategies within their broaderpublic health priorities to ensure that the goals of the interven-tion are achieved without compromising other valuable healthinitiatives. 26Both the ef \ufb01cacy and the cost-effectiveness of CKD detection and treatment interventions will depend upon thespeci\ufb01c strategies that are employed in the healthcare system. Therefore, results from future clinical trials should be evaluated within their unique context and may not generalize to all CKD detection efforts. Most people with or at risk for CKD, healthcare providers, and policy makers would wish to identify CKD. Most people who arealready receiving medical care would choose case- \ufb01nding stra- tegies to enable earlier risk strati \ufb01cation and treatment for pre- viously undiagnosed CKD. 17,64Thus, the application of earlier treatment to delay CKD progression in people with CKD is of a higher priority than the lack of clinical trial evidence", "that case-\ufb01nding strategies themselves improve outcomes. This practice point promoting CKD detection efforts may have implications for health equity, because CKD dispro-portionately affects people from minoritized populations andthose who have lower SES. The increasing availability andevidence supporting several treatments for CKD advocates forearly disease detection. Given the asymptomatic progression of CKD, systematic testing of people with risk factors for CKD is the only method that would detect CKD at earlystages and allow the initiation of appropriate treatments.CKD detection could reduce the proportion of people withCKD who will experience the morbidity of CKD G4 \u2013G5. Cost-effectiveness analyses, performed in the new era ofeffective disease-modifying therapies, describe a more positiveview of population-wide screening. 27 Figure 328provides an algorithm for the identi \ufb01cation of people at risk for CKD testing in those at risk, furthertesting in those identi \ufb01ed as having CKD to con \ufb01rm stages,and subsequently allowing for treatment initiation. Primarycare physicians or other medical specialists who care forpeople with risk factors for CKD, such as endocrinology,cardiology, or rheumatology, are ideal settings for an intervention that targets people with undetected CKD. Implementing an early detection intervention would befacilitated by integrated healthcare systems and the use ofelectronic health records. These structures would facilitatethe linkage between risk strati \ufb01cation and treatment to have the desired effect of slowing the progression of CKD. The highest priority conditions for CKD detection are hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, including heart failure. For diabetes, the ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening of people with diabetes for CKD. 29CKD screening should start at diagnosis of T2D because evidence of CKD is oftenalready apparent at this time. For T1D, screening isrecommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. Asecond important group includes people with recent AKI oracute kidney disease (AKD), particularly multiple episodesof AKI, and those who have been \u201cpartially diagnosed \u201dwith CKD by either eGFR or albuminuria but cannot be fullystaged. Other groups who might be considered for CKDtesting are shown in Table 5 . This list is not exhaustive and may be modi \ufb01ed by local epidemiological considerations. As per above, 2023 analyses suggest that population screeningmay in fact be cost-effective, obviating the need for\u201cselecting \u201dand addressing an ever-changing list of \u201cat risk \u201d groups. 27 Testing for CKD without regard to age generates contro- versy. Those in older age groups experience the greatestburden of CKD and are also at the highest risk for cardio-vascular complications. As with other detection programs likecancer detection, CKD detection efforts should be individu-alized based on the person \u2019s goals of care and suitability for treatment. Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), he-maturia, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests tocon\ufb01rm presence of CKD. There is known biological and analytical variability in SCr and in urine albumin or urine protein not related to theirproperties as markers of kidney disease. In people withoutrisk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD. Thus, any unexpected results should be veri \ufb01ed before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people", "with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the persondoes have CKD even with an unexpected \ufb01nding. Subsequent testing should be performed to con \ufb01rm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeatsample should be determined based on clinical settingincluding risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/ AKD. Hematuria is common and associated with risk for sub- sequent development of CKD. 65There are several causes ofchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S170 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 transient hematuria. Persistent hematuria may indicate glomerular disease, other kidney diseases, or urologicdisease including genitourinary malignancy. Thus, persistent hematuria should prompt further investigation. 66,67 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. People who are born preterm, especially if also small for gestational age, are at increased riskfor CKD and kidney failure. This is largely related to decreased nephron number. 68\u201370Additional insults after birth such as neonatal AKI and childhood obesity can further in-crease the risk of CKD. 71,72 1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimatedglomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimatedfrom the combination of creatinine and cystatin C(creatinine and cystatin C \u2013based estimated glomer- ular\ufb01ltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B). For the diagnosis and staging of CKD by GFR, this recom- mendation puts a high value on data suggesting that the most accurate method of estimating GFR is by using 2 biomarkers(cystatin C and creatinine), as each has limitations and bene \ufb01ts as\ufb01ltration markers. As compared with mGFR, estimatingequations using both creatinine and cystatin C afford greateraccuracy in comparison with either \ufb01ltration marker alone. The recommendation places a lower value on the resource utilization and cost associated with the assessment of eGFRcr-cys. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. In the CKD-PC collabora- tion, 720,736 people had measures of blood cystatin C in addi-tion to having eGFRcr and ACR. 12Replacing the assessment of eGFRcr with eGFRcr-cys in the matrix of GFR categories led to several changes in the risk distributions. Most notably, thegroup with an eGFR category 45 \u201359 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and ACR<10 mg/g ( <1 mg/mmol) was moved to higher risk for all 10 outcomes, and this category was no longer labeledas being low-risk ( \u201cgreen \u201d) for any of the complications (Figure 6 12). For the 8 outcomes that are not in \ufb02uenced by changes in creatinine (i.e. all except kidney failure and AKI),eGFRcr exhibited a J-shaped association such that riskincreased with eGFR values >105 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (Figure 712). In contrast eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution. These data demonstrate that thecombined eGFRcr-cys equation is superior for distinguishingGFR risk stages compared with eGFRcr. Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on 2 broadly different types of data \u2014data comparing the accuracy (P30) of equations from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C as \ufb01ltration markers and creatinine and cystatin CTable 5 |", "Risk factors for CKD Domains Example conditions Common risk factors Hypertension Diabetes Cardiovascular disease (including heart failure)Prior AKI/AKD People who live in geographical areas with high prevalence of CKDAreas with endemic CKDuAreas with the high prevalence of APOL1 genetic variants Environmental exposures Genitourinary disorders Structural urinary tract disease Recurrent kidney calculi Multisystem diseases/chronic in \ufb02ammatory conditionsSystemic lupus erythematosusVasculitisHIV Iatrogenic (related to drug treatments and procedures) Drug-induced nephrotoxicity and radiation nephritis Family history or known genetic variant associated with CKDKidney failure, regardless of identi \ufb01ed cause Kidney disease recognized to be associated with genetic abnormality (e.g., PKD, APOL1 -mediated kidney disease, and Alport syndrome) Gestational conditions Preterm birth Small gestational size Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia Occupational exposures that promote CKD risk Cadmium, lead, and mercury exposure Polycyclic hydrocarbons Pesticides AKD, acute kidney disease; AKI, acute kidney injury; APOL1 , apolipoprotein L1; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKDu, chronic kidney disease of undetermined origin; PKD, polycystic kidney disease.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S171 alone and data from the CKD-PC examining the risk of outcome by GFR stage assessed by eGFRcr compared witheGFRcr-cys. As compared with equations based on creatinineand cystatin C alone, the equation using both creatinine and cystatin C comes closest to mGFR most consistently (Supplementary Table S3 73\u201396). The CKD-PC data were an individual-level data analysis of 27,503,140 participantsfrom 114 global cohorts (eGFRcr) and 720,736 participantsfrom 20 cohorts (eGFRcr-cys) and 9,067,753 participantsfrom 114 cohorts (albuminuria) from 1980 to 2021 fromaround the world conveying a high degree of robustness inthe association of CKD stage with a broad range of adverse outcomes. Based on the totality and consistency of the CKD-PC data, the overall certainty of the evidence wasrated as moderate. Values and preferences. This recommendation places a high value on the need for the most accurate assessment of GFR.The Work Group judged that many people at risk for CKDwould prefer an accurate measurement when con \ufb01rming the diagnosis of CKD and its staging. For this reason, the Work Group prioritized eGFRcr-cys over eGFRcr or eGFRcys for the most accurate measurement. The recommendation puts alow value on the availability and cost of an assessment ofeGFRcr-cys suggesting that people at risk of CKD would optfor the more accurate assessment. Resource use and costs. The costs and resource use associ- ated with eGFRcr-cys are currently greater than those ofeGFRcr; however, the need for an accurate measurement may offset these expenses. In addition, accurate diagnosis of CKD as early as possible may lead to lower resource utilization andhealthcare spending than if diagnosed in later stages of CKD.For more information on the costs associated with cystatin Cassessments, please refer to Section 1.2.2 . Considerations for implementation. The biggest consideration for implementation is the availability of cystatin C measurement.For this reason, the recommendation includes the alternative for eGFRcr in such cases taking into consideration the limitations and drawbacks of creatinine-based measurements. Rationale The KDIGO CKD staging system based on 2 dimensions,GFR and albuminuria, was created largely to re \ufb02ect the as- sociation of outcomes of people", "with CKD, relative to theearlier staging systems based solely on GFR stages. Assessmentof GFR stage is ideally performed using accurate assessmentof GFR and ACR and is used to best capture the prognosis for people with CKD with regard to outcomes such as kidney failure, CVD, and mortality risk. There is now a large evi-dence base demonstrating that the use of eGFRcr-cys reclas-si\ufb01es a large proportion of the population into different GFR stages and the \u201cnew\u201dstages better re \ufb02ect their risk associa- tions. For that reason, where available, cystatin C should beadded to creatinine for the purpose of estimating GFR forCKD diagnosis and staging.1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of aminimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i)review of past measurements/estimations of GFR; (ii)review of past measurements of albuminuria orproteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii)imaging \ufb01ndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv)kidney pathological \ufb01ndings such as \ufb01brosis and atrophy; (v)medical history, especially conditions known tocause or contribute to CKD; (vi)repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity basedupon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the \ufb01nding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at \ufb01rst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators. Kidney diseases may be acute or chronic. 1,97We explicitly yet arbitrarily de \ufb01ne the duration of a minimum of 3 months (>90 days) as delineating \u201cchronic \u201dkidney disease. The rationale for de \ufb01ning chronicity is to differentiate CKD from AKDs (such as acute glomerulonephritis [GN]), including AKI, which may require different timelines forinitiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on theclinical context. For example, a person with decreased GFRor kidney damage during an acute illness, without priordocumentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to haveAKD. Resolution over days to weeks would con \ufb01rm the diagnosis of AKI from a variety of different causes. Aperson with similar \ufb01ndings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD, and if followed overtime, would be con \ufb01rmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage isrecommended for accurate diagnosis and staging. Thetiming of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, withearlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI andlater evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diag- nosis for the sake of con \ufb01rming chronicity can delay care. Many people may not recognize the importance ofa repeat visit if treatment had not been initiated. Thus,initiating treatment both allows for earlier interventionand also indicates to people the importance of thedisease.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S172 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Newborns who clearly have kidney disease", "(e.g., severe congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract) do not need to wait 3 months to con \ufb01rm CKD. 1.1.4 Evaluation of cause Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD usingclinical context, personal and family history, social andenvironmental factors, medications, physical examination,laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologicdiagnosis ( Figure 8). Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause basedon resources available ( Table 6 22,98-100). In evaluation of cause, healthcare providers should select speci\ufb01c diagnostic tests based on the pretest probability of a speci\ufb01c diagnosis informed by clinical presentation. Identi \ufb01ca- tion of cause confers bene \ufb01t for targeting therapy to slow pro- gression to kidney failure, understanding contributing factors,and prognosis. In addition, identi \ufb01cation of cause can help people communicate information about a genetic or familialcause to relatives, improve understanding of their condition in the context of self-care management, and improve health literacy. Genetic testing is emerging as a valuable component for evaluation of cause. In some studies, >10% of people with CKD, regardless of family history, were observed to carry genetic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant(s) thatrepresent a plausible molecular cause for the development orprogression of CKD. 101\u2013103In some cases, identi \ufb01cation of actionable genes through genetic testing can impact the clinical management of people with CKD ( Figure 9100).104,105 The prevalence of genetic causes to CKD is expected to increase in future years through increased recognition. A recent KDIGO Controversies Conference listed the following recommendations for when genetic testing can be particularlyinformative: (i) high prevalence of monogenic subtypes within theclinical category, (ii) early age of onset of CKD, (iii) syndromic/multisystem features, (iv) consanguinity, (v) possibility of iden-tifying a condition amenable to targeted treatment, and (vi) CKD/ kidney failure of unknown etiology when kidney biopsy would not be informative due to advanced disease. 100 The KDIGO Controversies Conference also highlighted the importance of an educated workforce with expertise inkidney genetics, genomics, and computational research forappropriate use and interpretation of these tests (Figure10 100). Access to genetic counseling and medical genetics is important for psychosocial support, appropriate use of genetic testing, and to limit costs.102 Most people with a new diagnosis of CKD and their healthcare providers would prefer to undertake evaluation for the underlying cause to ensure that the best possible care isprovided. Although some people identi \ufb01ed as having CKD may prefer not to undergo the (sometimes invasive) pro-cedures to evaluate cause, establishing cause enables the mostappropriate management strategy to be implemented. Resources available for evaluation of cause will vary worldwide. People may not be able to pay for some diagnostictests. Therefore, healthcare providers should tailor the eval-uation of cause based on these resource constraints (e.g.,urine protein reagent strip testing instead of ACR). Education on the value of establishing a diagnosis of CKD is critical. This can be done through local, national, and in-ternational kidney societies and within healthcare training programs (Chapter 5 ). Additional resources may be required to support wider scale implementation of diagnostic tests, especially genetic testing, availability of", "biopsies, and thesupport required for implementation. Identi \ufb01cation of cause is often achieved by standard clin- ical methods (i.e., history and examination), knowledge of thecauses of CKD and their manifestations (i.e., level of GFR andspeci\ufb01c marker of kidney damage such as hematuria, urine albumin, or cysts), together with specialized investigations(Figure 8 ). Not all evaluations of cause are required in all people. Information from the clinical context and initialtests may lead to further evaluations ( Table 6 ), which are likely to be conducted as part of specialized kidney careservices and dependent on resources (Chapter 5 ). Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate (2D). This recommendation places a high value on an acceptable safety pro\ufb01le of kidney biopsies when used to evaluate the cause of CKD and to plan appropriate treatment.

The harms include the possibility of complications of theprocedure (bleeding risk/pain), the obtaining of a non-diagnostic or insuf \ufb01cient sample (wasted resource), and the anxiety induced while awaiting the results. The systematic review performed by the ERT identi \ufb01ed 37 studies assessing the prognostic bene \ufb01t and safety of kidney biopsy among people with CKD. Ten studies examined thediagnostic and/or prognostic bene \ufb01t of kidney biopsy or in- \ufb02uence of biopsy results on management decisions. Thediagnostic \ufb01ndings were heterogeneous and variable, which did not lend themselves to further synthesis. The rate ofmortality after native kidney biopsy in people with suspectedor diagnosed CKD was low. Across the 15 studies that re-ported on mortality after a native kidney biopsy, there were 3reported deaths. The rate of perirenal hematoma across 14studies was estimated to be 16% (95% con \ufb01dence interval [CI]: 12% \u201322%). No studies reported on retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Supplementary Table S4 106\u2013126). Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for kidney biopsy and outcomes of harms is very low ( Supplementary Table S4106\u2013 126). The critical outcomes, mortality and perirenal hematomas, were primarily assessed in observational studieswithout a comparison group. Because of the potential forconfounding, the ERT considered the body of evidence to haveTable 6 | Guidance for the selection of additional tests for evaluation of cause Test category Examples Comment", "or key references Imaging Ultrasound, intravenous urography, CT kidneys ureters bladder, nuclear medicine studies, MRIAssess kidney structure (i.e., kidney shape, size, symmetry, and evidence of obstruction) for cystic disease and re \ufb02ux disease.

The ERT did not identify any studies that reported on the criticaloutcome of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that many people with CKD would choose to undergo a kidney biopsyto establish the cause of their CKD more accurately andpotentially offer prognostic information. Thus, this recom- mendation puts a high value on the speci \ufb01city of a kidney biopsy for the evaluation of cause as well as the very low certainty evidence demonstrating a low risk of complicationsassociated with kidney biopsy. Because the potential that theinformation gleaned from the biopsy may not directly orimmediately bene \ufb01t the person, the Work Group judged that some people may prefer to decline a kidney biopsy. The de-cision to pursue biopsy should be a shared decision and be informed by probability of and utility of the information obtained on both diagnostic and prognostic fronts. Resource use and costs. Resources available for evaluation of cause will vary worldwide and is dependent on thehealthcare systems. People with CKD may not be able to payfor biopsy or afford the time away from work for the pro-cedure. Resources in speci \ufb01c countries may not permit appropriate analysis of the obtained samples. Thus, healthcare providers \u2019decisions to perform a kidney biopsy in the pres- ence of limited resources may therefore be in \ufb02uenced based on expected yield for that individual and the perceived value of the extra information gained.Considerations for implementation. To optimize bene \ufb01t and safety, a standardized approach for kidney biopsy with avetted and standardized operating protocol designed for localimplementation is warranted. Of note, most studies reportedusing ultrasound-guided biopsies and older literature sug-gesting higher bleeding rates were conducted in the absence of guided biopsies; thus, we might infer that there is a po- tential for higher rate of harms in \u201cblind \u201d/unguided biopsies. Rationale Kidney biopsy is an important part of the investigations forthe cause of CKD. It is often deferred because of the potentialfor harm or lack of recognition of potential utility. The evi-dence to support safety of biopsy is heterogeneous andtherefore uncertain, but in the studies evaluated, appears toconfer low risk of harm, supporting our suggestion thatkidney biopsies should be considered when it is thought thatthey can provide information to identify cause, facilitate prognostication, and inform treatment strategies. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Children and young people with kidney failure are more likely to have a genetic cause of theirdisease than adults. In some healthcare settings, genetic testing may be pursued \ufb01rst, obviating the need for kidney biopsy and the associated risks, which may be different inchildren than adults. 1.2 Evaluation of GFR The kidney has many functions, including excretory, endo-crine, and metabolic functions.

In this section, we describe the overall approach for the evaluation of GFR. As in the previous KDIGO ClinicalPractice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease, 1the\ufb01rst method to evaluate GFR should be eGFRcr. If necessary for greater accuracy, theapproach then recommends subsequent supportive testsfrom either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurementof GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous \ufb01ltration markers. In contrast to the previous guideline, we emphasize the use of eGFRcr-cys based on accumulatingevidence for its greater accuracy across populations and theuse of mGFR given the known residual errors in allestimating equations. We also describe laboratorytechniques and standards that satisfy the requirements forrobust result reporting. We encourage healthcare providersto have a clear understanding of the value and limitations of both \ufb01ltration markers and mGFR, the importance of standardization of assays for creatinine and cystatin C, and quality control procedures for exogenous markers. Finally,we describe currently available, validated estimatingequations that can be used for the reporting of GFR byclinical laboratories. 1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term \u201cGFR \u201dwhen referring to the speci \ufb01c kidney function of glomerular \ufb01ltration. Use the more general term \u201ckidney function(s)\u201d when dealing with the totality of functions of the kidney. The kidneys play several roles in the body, including metabolism and excretion of substances, volume and BPregulation, erythropoietin production, and regulation ofelectrolytes, acid-base status, and mineral homeostasis.Glomerular \ufb01ltration is one of many functions of the kidney. GFR is considered the best overall assessment of kidneyfunctions as, in general, losses of these other functions correlate with the loss of GFR. The term \u201ckidney function \u201d re\ufb02ects the entirety of different and complex physiological functions of the kidney; thus, kidney function should not be a term used interchangeably with GFR. Assessment of the overall functions of the kidney is a complex task. GFR", "is used as the primary tool to assess kidneyfunction in practice. Loss of other kidney functions areknown as complications of CKD and are addressed in Chapter 3 . This section focuses on how GFR can be evaluated using both mGFR and eGFR. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. There are numerous kidney dis- orders in children that may present with tubular dysfunction (e.g., Bartter \u2019s and Dent disease) rather than decreased GFRor albuminuria. These primarily result in polyuria and/orelectrolyte disturbances and may or may not progress toreduced GFR or kidney failure. Thus, the exclusive use of GFRin diagnosing CKD would not be of value in children, high- lighting the importance of appreciating different markers linked to different kidney functions. 1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers We describe a framework for evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Tables 7 and8 127\u2013142). Figure 11 depicts an algorithm for evaluation of GFR from initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decisions for when toperform supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR(Tables 7 and8). Healthcare providers should consider both potential sources of error in eGFR as well as whether theclinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR whenconsidering the need for additional tests. The level ofaccuracy that is needed for a clinical decision for the use ofpotentially toxic medications, a medication with a narrowtherapeutic window, or for other therapies with potentialfor adverse events, may exceed the capability of any eGFRequation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed. This assessment would ideally be performed every time a GFR value is used to make a clinical decision. Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR(Figure 11 ). There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, esti- mating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging,and monitoring the progression of CKD, and observationaldata documented an increase in CKD recognition and referralto nephrologists shortly after the implementation of reportingof eGFR by clinical laboratories, especially for females andelderly people. 143\u2013145GFR is used in many routine and complex clinical decisions as an assessment of excretory kidney function ( Table 4 ) to detect and stage AKD and CKD, determine CKD progression, dose medications, determine appropriate use of diagnostic tests, and guide treatmentdecisions around KRT therapies. Equations are availablethat estimate GFR using SCr and adjusting for sex and age,and professional societies throughout the world haverecommended that GFR estimates should be used inassociation with SCr reporting. Sources of error in GFR estimation from SCr concentration include non\u2013 steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinineassays. GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levelsthan at lower levels, and healthcare providers should remainaware of caveats for any estimating equation that mayin\ufb02uence the accuracy in an individual person.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S176 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Most people with", "CKD and their healthcare providers would prefer the more accurate assessment of kidney function resulting from the use of GFR estimating equations compared with SCr alone. Minimal cost or resources issues are expected because creatinine is available in healthcare settings globally, and evalu-ating GFR with the use of creatinine in the form of GFR esti-mating equations has been recommended for >20 years. eGFR from creatinine is widely used. Attention is required to implement and ensure the quality of eGFR reporting byclinical laboratories and ensure coordination with the elec-tronic medical record (EMR), including those eGFR reports from point-of-care settings (Section 1.2.2 ).Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is lessaccurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making (Table 8 127-142)(1C). This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequateassessment of GFR. There is consistent evidence that eGFRcr-cysprovides more accurate estimates of mGFR than eGFRcr andeGFRcys in ambulatory people.Initial test \u2013 eGFRcr* Consider sources of error and need for more accurate assessment.

The algorithm describes the approach to the evaluation of GFR. The approach uses initial and supportive testing to develop a \ufb01nal assessment of true GFR and to apply it in individual decision-making. The initial test for the evaluation of GFR is creatinine-based estimated GFR (eGFRcr), which will be available for most people because creatinine is measured routinely as part of the basic metabolic panel. If eGFRcr is expected to be inaccurate, or if a moreaccurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, such as diagnosis or staging of chronic kidney disease or drug dosing, then,if available, cystatin C should be measured, and creatinine and cystatin C \u2013based estimated GFR (eGFRcr-cys) should be estimated. If eGFRcr-cys is expected to be inaccurate, or if an even more accurate assessment of GFR is needed for clinical decision-making, then, if available, GFR shouldbe measured using plasma or urinary clearance of exogenous \ufb01ltration markers. *Initial test may be estimated GFR by cystatin C (eGFRcys or eGFRcr-cys) in otherwise healthy populations with changes in creatinine generation due to non-GFR determinants such as changes in musclemass or creatinine secretion or extrarenal elimination due to the use of speci \ufb01c medications. \u2020Sources of error in eGFRcr-cys include very low muscle mass or very high levels of in \ufb02ammation, high catabolic states, or exogenous steroid use.\u2021Consider eGFRcys rather than eGFRcr-cys in otherwise healthy populations with decreased creatinine generation due to reduced muscle mass or decreased creatinine secretion orextrarenal elimination due to the use of speci \ufb01c medications.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024)", "105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S177 Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. Please see Practice Point 1.2.2.1 regarding the bene \ufb01t of accurate assessment of GFR for clinical decision-making. In clinical practice, there may be situations where the estimation of GFR from SCr alone may be a source of error, for example, muscle wasting/loss, or where greater accuracy of GFR estimation is required forclinical decision-making (e.g., drug dosing). In most of thesesituations, estimating GFR using a combined creatinine andcystatin C equation provides the required degree of accuracyand obviates the need for expensive and time-consumingmeasurement of GFR using an approved gold standardmethodology. GFR estimating equations that incorporate both creatinine and cystatin C have particular bene \ufb01t in terms of improved accuracy in relation to mGFR compared with equivalent equations using only one of these markers. 91,92,146\u2013149 In 2 large-scale studies in pooled cohorts of general pop- ulation cohorts and clinical populations in North Americaand Europe, the P 30(de\ufb01ned as the percentage of the eGFR values within /C630% of mGFR) using eGFRcr-cys is in the range of 90%,91,147which is considered optimal.1Greater accuracy of eGFRcr-cys compared with eGFRcr or eGFRcysis also observed in studies evaluating GFR estimatingequations compared with mGFR in other countries such asBrazil, Congo, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan, and China, withP 30estimated between 80% and 90%,77,78,83,88,93,136,150\u2013154 which is considered adequate for most decision-making.1 Potential harms include increased costs, as described below, and greater complexity in the interpretation of GFR with discrepant results between eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and eGFRcr-cys. This in turn may lead to an increased number ofnephrology consults, especially initially as healthcare pro-viders may be unfamiliar with these new tests. Certainty of evidence. The Work Group considered the overall certainty of the evidence to be moderate to high inambulatory people who were neither frail nor had acute orchronic illnesses, and low in other populations due to in-consistencies and imprecision in the studies currently avail-able in the literature. Most of the studies used in thedevelopment and initial external validation of these equationswere performed in ambulatory people who were neither frailnor had acute or chronic illnesses. There remains a paucity ofstudies examining the accuracy of eGFR in such pop-ulations. 142Many studies that have been performed in such populations are small, increasing risk for analyticalvariability, and show inconsistent results among the studieseven within the same disease. Some reports in populationswith cancer, HIV, or obesity demonstrate greater accuracyfor eGFRcr-cys than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. 132\u2013135,155\u2013157 Consistent with these \ufb01ndings, a large study of people living in Stockholm, Sweden referred for an mGFR test who haddiagnoses for heart failure, liver failure, cancer, CVD, or diabetes found eGFRcr-cys to be the most accurate and least biased. 82In other studies of sick or frail people, such as very advanced liver or heart failure or those admitted tothe intensive care unit, all eGFR tests demonstrated verylow levels of accuracy. 73,137,158\u2013161 There are insuf \ufb01cient data to indicate the accuracy of eGFRcr, eGFRcys, or eGFRcr-cys for many diseases. Forexample, in people with high cell turnover such as hematologic cancers, we", "expect that cystatin C would provide highly inac- curate estimates due to the increase in cystatin C because of cellturnover rather than decreased GFR disease. 162\u2013165However, there are no data to evaluate that hypothesis. Importantly, evenfor people from populations where eGFRcr-cys has beendemonstrated to be more accurate, healthcare providers shouldassess the potential sources of error in eGFR and the need for ahighly accurate level of GFR. Among people who are frail or with multiple comorbid illnesses, eGFRcr-cys may be insuf \ufb01- ciently accurate due to large contributions from non-GFR determinants of creatinine, cystatin C, or both markers.Conversely, in otherwise healthy populations with decreasedTable 7 | Description of initial and supportive tests for the evaluation of GFR GFR assessment method Speci \ufb01c tests Guidance for use and implementation Estimated GFR Creatinine (eGFRcr) Most used method to assess GFR.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most people and most healthcare providers would want to use themost accurate assessment of GFR available to them andwould, therefore, wish to estimate GFR from a combinationof creatinine and cystatin C, when available. However, theywould also balance additional costs associated with cystatin Cagainst the potential bene \ufb01ts. Differences", "between eGFRcr and eGFRcys may prompt recognition that both are estimates of GFR and both are asso-ciated with error, requiring interpretation as to the best esti-mate of GFR. In our view, this is desirable, and uncertainty as tothe level of GFR is an indication for nephrology referral. Resource use and costs. Costs for the higher frequency of cystatin C testing include one-time costs associated with initi-ation of the assay within a laboratory, which include buildingthe information technology infrastructure and method veri \ufb01- cation studies, and continuous costs associated with main-taining the assay, which include reagents, daily quality control,requirements for calibration veri \ufb01cation, and pro \ufb01ciency testing. Reagent costs are currently more expensive thancreatinine but are lower compared with other commonly usedbiomarkers. If cystatin C is performed in an outside laboratory,other costs, as with any laboratory test, may ensue. Additionalcosts may also be a result of the increased referrals to ne- phrologists to assist the interpretation of potentially discordant results between eGFRcr and eGFRcys. Ideally, these decreaseover time with increased utilization. Considerations for implementation. We recognize that for these recommendations to be implemented, cystatin C needsto be widely available. Wherever possible, access to bothcreatinine and cystatin C measurements should be madeavailable when evaluating GFR. Education for healthcare providers and people with CKD for optimal use and inter- pretation of these tests is required. See Section 1.2.3 for details regarding the measurement of creatinine and cystatin C byclinical laboratories.Rationale We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous \ufb01ltration marker that is now increasingly available. Its assay can be put on autoanalyzers, and therefore its utilization couldbe increased with clinical demand. eGFRcr-cys provides the most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary supportive test for people in whom there are concerns abouteGFRcr accuracy ( Table 8 127\u2013142). However, there remain residual errors with some groups of people having a very highlevel of errors. In such people, we advocate using mGFR. Weanticipate that such considerations be made at every encounterwhere GFR is being used for a clinical decision. Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR usingplasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous \ufb01ltration marker ( Table 9). Given the bene \ufb01t of accurate assessment of GFR for clin- ical decision-making, there is a need to appreciate the valueand circumstances in which directly mGFR is required. Thegreatest bene \ufb01t of mGFR is that it is less in \ufb02uenced by non- GFR determinants, in contrast to eGFR. GFR is measuredusing exogenous \ufb01ltration markers and urinary or plasma clearance. The precision of mGFR can be determined from variability with repeated measures. Time-to-time variability is the method used to assess error. One systematic review summarizing the available data comparing current GFR measurement methods to each otherand to the classic gold standard of inulin urinary clearance rec-ommended the use of iothalamate, iohexol, ethyl-enediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) as", "exogenous markers of choice. 166A subsequent study recommended against plasma99mTc-DTPA, especially when clearances are performed over 2 \u20134h o u r s .167 Several studies demonstrate that the method by which theclearance of exogenous markers is measured may impactaccuracy. For example, for people with lower GFRs, delayedblood sampling is most accurate, whereas for people with Table 9 | Comparison of estimated GFR and measured GFR Estimated GFR by SCr and/or cystatin C Measured GFR Inexpensive and easy to implement More expensive, more time-consuming, and invasive Widely available and may also be used at point of care, easily repeatableOnly available in certain centers Methods to measure that do not require urine collections are available (i.e., plasma clearance)Most protocols require repeat blood samples potentially over a long durationMicrosampling tests by \ufb01ngerpick enable point-of-care testing.

Requires individualized protocols Lags behind changes in GFR Able to identify early changes in GFR Subject to non-GFR determinant confounding Less in \ufb02uenced by non-GFR determinants GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; SCr, serum creatinine.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S180 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 better-preserved GFRs, earlier blood sampling is most accurate, and in people with extensive edema or ascites, plasma clearanceprotocols are very inaccurate and not recommended; instead, urinary clearance protocols are recommended. 167Finally, it is well recognized that assessing GFR using the imaging of nuclear tracers is less accurate than eGFR, and we do notrecommend it as a method to measure GFR. 168 The evaluation of time-to-time variability of plasma clearance of iohexol and eGFR found a within-subject bio-logical coef \ufb01cient of variation (CV) for mGFR of 6.7% (95% CI: 5.6% \u20138.2%), whereas CVs for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and eGFRcr-cys were approximately 5.0%. 169Other studies have observed CV for this same mGFR method ranging fromapproximately 5% to 10%. 169,170There are less data for other methods; for urinary clearance of iothalamate,estimated CVs were 6.3% and 16.6% across 2 studies. 171\u2013173 The Work Group judged that there will be some clinical situations where estimating GFR from both creatinine andcystatin C will be insuf \ufb01ciently reliable or precise, and the greatest bene \ufb01t and least harm will be achieved by measuring GFR with the appropriate standardized methods. Costs for mGFR are variable and harder to quantify. The infrastructure required is greater, as testing requires bothpatient and personnel time for inserting a peripheral intra-venous catheter, administering the exogenous marker, col-lecting serial blood specimens over several hours (dependingon the protocol), and the associated materials for the collection and measuring blood levels by high-performance liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Utilization ofmGFR may require input from a nephrologist in some set-tings, which would also add to the costs of testing. All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at least 1 method to measure GFRusing plasma or urinary clearanceof exogenous markers. T o ensure highly accurate measurements,these clearance methods should be performed using standard operating procedures. External", "quality assessment (EQA) should be used for assays of the exogenous markers. Special consider-ations in clearance methods are required for some populations toobtain a high level of accuracy (e.g., later sampling time forpeople with low GFR or urinary, instead of plasma clearance foredematous people). GFR centers, under the direction of anephrologist champion or laboratory director, analogous tocardiac imaging, are likely to help both increase utilization and ensure high quality results. There will be additional requirements for storage, administration, and disposal if radionuclide meth-odologies are adopted. National kidney societies can work withpayers to support reimbursement for mGFR procedures. TheEuropean Kidney Function Consortium (EKFC) together withthe European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and LaboratoryMedicine is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures for GFR measurements in the near future. Decisions to measure GFR should be made by both ne- phrologists and other physicians using the framework sug-gested in Figure 11 . Physicians should determine how accurate the GFR needs to be for a speci \ufb01c clinical decision. If greater accuracy is needed than can be achieved using eGFR, mGFRis recommended. Greater accuracy may be required due to inaccuracy of eGFR in the individual person due to the presence of non-GFR determinants or due to the requirementof the clinical setting. Table 10 lists indications for when one might consider mGFR as opposed to eGFRcr-cys. We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginning with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). mGFR is recommended when there are concerns about the accuracy of eGFRcr-cys ( Table 8 127-142)o r where an accurate level of GFR is required for optimaldecision-making, as described in Table 10 . Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitationsin both eGFR and measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in \ufb02uence SCr and cystatin C measurements. All studies evaluating the performance of eGFR compared with mGFR observe error in any GFR estimate. Even inpopulations where there is a high accuracy (i.e., P 30of 90%), 10% of the population would have errors $30% relative to mGFR. Within these studies, error rates are likely to be higherin some subgroups and lower in others. A critical componentof the recommended approach to evaluation of GFR ( Figure 11) is that physicians have a clear understanding of the value and limitations of eGFR and mGFR, which de \ufb01nes when a person requires one or another supportive test. The source of error in eGFR may be related to errors in eGFR or in mGFR ( Figure 12 174). The most important sources of error are non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C. Thenon-GFR determinants of creatinine include generation by dietand muscle mass, tubular secretion, and extrarenalelimination. 130,175The non-GFR determinants of cystatin C are less well understood but thought to be higher adiposity, smoking, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, glucocorticoid excess, and chronic in \ufb02ammation (as indicated by insulin resistance, higher levels of C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor,or lower", "levels of serum albumin). 129,130,176\u2013185Table 10 | Indications for measured GFR Clinical conditions in which eGFRcr-cys is inaccurate or uncertain due to potential non-GFR determinants of creatinine and cystatin C. This may include catabolic states, such as serious infections or in \ufb02ammatory states, high cell turnover as in some cancers, advanced cirrhosis or heart failure, use of high- dose steroids, or the very frail. See Figure 12 for approach to individual decision-making. Clinical settings in which greater accuracy is needed than is achieved with eGFRcr-cys. For example, decisions about simultaneous kidney transplan ta t the time of other solid organ transplant, kidney donor candidacy, and drug dosing if there is a narrow therapeutic index or serious toxicity (e.g.,chemotherapies that are cleared by the kidney). eGFRcr-cys, estimated GFR by creatinine and cystatin C; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S181 mGFR also differs from the true physiological GFR, which itself cannot be directly measured. Errors may be related to analytical errors in the assay or the clearance procedure. For example, the overestimation of GFR is seen if late samples are not taken for people with low GFR.167,186Urinary clearances are preferred to plasma clearance methods in people withextensive third spacing of \ufb02uid. 169\u2013173In the absence of changes related to disease progression, a change in mGFRfrom time to time may occur due to preanalytical (e.g.,patient preparation and time of day), analytical (laboratorymeasurement variability), and biological (changes in true physiological GFR) variability, as is the case for eGFR. This does not detract from the advantage of mGFR as being freefrom non-GFR determinants. It is important fornephrologists to appreciate and understand these errors andnuances to appropriately order the right tests in speci \ufb01c circumstances. Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake. Most studies measuring GFR for clinical or research pur- poses are performed in the morning after a period of fasting or moderate protein intake. Ideally, optimal application of eGFRwould simulate these conditions. Several studies havedocumented the impact of a cooked meat or \ufb01sh meal on creatinine concentrations. 187For example, one study demonstrates increase in SCr of approximately 20 mmol/l (0.23 mg/dl) which in the study population was equivalent todecrease in eGFR of approximately 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Maximum postprandial effects were reached in some subjectsby 2 hours and others by 4 hours. Waiting for at least 12hours before the measurement of SCr, after meat or \ufb01sh intake, best avoids this effect. We recognize that this approachmay be challenging to implement in the clinical environment. Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time. When evaluating a change in eGFR over time, the question is whether the true GFR is changing. However as describedabove, there are several other potential causes for a change inobserved eGFR, other than AKI, such as changes in non-GFRdeterminants of the \ufb01ltration markers or analytical errors in the assays. Healthcare providers should consider whether there has been a", "change in non-GFR determinants (e.g., a recent meat meal now or at the \ufb01rst measurement or change in muscle mass or extreme activity). The impact of thecombined effect of analytical and biological variation oneGFR in determining progression is discussed in Chapter 2.

It is important to determine how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for clinical decision-making. P 30for eGFR refers to the percent of eGFRs that are within 30% of mGFR. If accuracy within 30% is acceptable (P 30>80%) or optimal (P 30>90%), eGFR may be suf \ufb01cient, provided that there are not large deviations in non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C. If greater accuracy is needed, mGFR is advised. The accuracy for mGFR is based on time-to-time variability. P 15for mGFR refers to the percent of one mGFR that was within 15% of the second. At a GFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 42 to 78 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 51 to 69 ml/min per 1.73 m2. At a GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 21 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 26 to 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Non-GFR determinants of endogenous \ufb01ltration markers include generation, tubular handling, and extrarenal elimination. Nonideal properties of exogenous \ufb01ltration markers include tabular handling and extrarenal elimination. Reproduced from Kidney International , volume 96, issue 2, Inker LA, Levey AS.

The combination of eGFRcr and eGFRcys together is more accurate than eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone.91,147The greater accuracy is due to the fact that the non-GFR determinantsfor each marker are different, and therefore using both leads to convergence on the estimate of GFR and minimizes the effect of either marker. 188 In individuals where non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C are substantially greater than for the othermarker, eGFRcr-cys would not provide the more accurateestimate. This imbalance is more likely to occur for creati-nine, given its association with diet and muscle mass,", "whichcan vary greatly across various people. In such cases, it would be reasonable to use eGFRcys. The non-GFR determinants for cystatin C are less well studied, and it is erroneous to assume that eGFRcys provides the more accurate estimate in all circumstances. We, there-fore, advise limiting this strategy to selected clinical settingswhere people are otherwise healthy with known changes innon-GFR determinants of creatinine. For example, in 1 studythat compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys before and after ampu- tation in otherwise healthy military veterans, there was a sizable change in eGFRcr as would be expected with the lossof a limb and loss of mobility, but no change in eGFRcys. 128 In another study of people with anorexia, serum levels ofcystatin C were more strongly correlated with mGFR thanwere levels of SCr, but this has not been further evaluatedusing eGFR and standardized assays. 127Other situations may be where there are medications that inhibit tubular secretion of creatinine, although there are no studies to provide evidence to drive guidance. Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of dif- ferences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may beinformative, in both direction and magnitude of thosedifferences. For people who have simultaneous SCr and cystatin C values, the agreement or discrepancy between eGFRcr andeGFRcys may help to guide further actions. Several studieshave demonstrated that 25% \u201330% of people have discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys as large as or larger than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2or$20%.82,138,189One study demonstrated that factors associated with higher values for eGFRcrcompared with eGFRcys included older age, female sex,non\u2013Black race, higher eGFR, higher BMI, weight loss, and current smoking. 190Two recent studies demonstrate that when there is concordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys,there is high and similar accuracy for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, andeGFRcr-cys with estimated P 30of 87% \u201391%.82,138,189Incontrast, when there is discordance, eGFRcr-cys is moreaccurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. This suggests thatwhen eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, it is reasonableto continue to measure cystatin C serially in addition to creatinine in those settings where GFR will affect clinical decisions. It is also reasonable to consider performing/conducting mGFR when using medications with narrowtherapeutic index or high toxicity or to inform criticaltreatment decisions (Chapter 4 ). Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections formeasured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate. mGFR is not available everywhere. In these settings, it might be reasonable to consider measured urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl). It is widely available and thereforecommonly used but is highly prone to error due to under- orovercollection. A systematic review of GFR methods observeda mean bias of 25% across 23 studies, and as such, did not\ufb01nd this method to reach suf \ufb01cient accuracy. 166The errors occur in both directions and thus do not appear solely dueto the presence of tubular secretion of creatinine, whichwould be expected to overestimate mGFR. For example, inthe pilot study for the African American Study of KidneyDisease (AASK), 25% of participants had a 24-hourmeasured CrCl that was at least 18% lower than the mGFR,and another", "25% had measured CrCl at least 23% greaterthan the GFR. Of note, measured CrCl had substantially better correlation with mGFR when it was measured during an mGFR procedure 191; therefore, if measured CrCl is to be performed, then it should ideally be supervised given thehigh risk of inaccuracy with urine collection. Special considerations Sex and gender considerations. It is unclear how best to estimate GFR in people who are transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary, where a person \u2019s gender identity is different from their sex assigned at birth. Gender-af \ufb01rming testos- terone therapy is associated with an increase in SCr concen- tration,192with less certainty for the impact of estrogen. Gender-af \ufb01rming testosterone therapy is associated with an increase in serum cystatin C and gender-af \ufb01rming estradiol, and antiandrogen therapy is associated with a decrease inserum cystatin C. 193The impact of gender-af \ufb01rming hormone therapy, if any, on true GFR is unknown. Inkeeping with guidance from the American Association ofClinical Chemistry and the National Kidney Foundation, 194 evaluation of eGFR should use a shared decision-makingapproach with the person with CKD, taking into accountmuscle mass, sex hormone milieu, sex assigned at birth,and gender identity. We also note that the new EKFCcystatin equation does not include a variable for sex. Pediatric considerations. There are currently insuf \ufb01cient externally validated data to assess if combining creatinine andcystatin improves the performance of pediatric eGFR equa-tions. Internal analysis of the Chronic Kidney Disease inwww.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S183 Children (CKiD) cohort revealed that averaging the eGFRcr and eGFRcys reduced mean bias in people who are Black,White, and other race. Likewise, averaging eGFRs derivedfrom the equations improved accuracy to 89% \u201391% (as assessed by P 30) across race groups. This has not been externally validated.195 1.2.3 Guidance to clinical laboratories Practice Point 1.2.3.1: Implement the laboratory standardsof care outlined in Table 11 to ensure accuracy and reliability when assessing GFR using creatinine andcystatin C. Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurementof both creatinine and cystatin either as an in-house test oras a referred test. Consistency, standardization, and comparability of labo- ratory measures of creatinine and cystatin C; the reporting ofresults and of GFR estimates; and the \ufb02agging of reported results where indicated are of paramount importance. Theassays used should have the required speci \ufb01city for the ana- lyte, and the calibration of assays is essential for the inter-pretation of kidney function measures. Results should betraceable to reference materials and methods listed on theJoint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine(JCTLM) database. Estimation of GFR improves identi \ufb01cation of CKD. Adoption of the laboratory standards described here willensure that healthcare providers receive eGFR reports in aconsistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracyand reliability of the result. Flagging decreased values foreGFR can alert healthcare providers to the possibility ofkidney disease and may indicate the need for additionalevaluation or adjustment of doses of medications that areexcreted by the kidney. Globally, most creatinine measurements are undertaken using a colorimetric", "method (Jaffe). This method also reactswith a variety of substances that are not creatinine (so-called\u201cnon-creatinine chromogens, \u201de.g., glucose and acetoacetate),typically comprising some 20% of the measured substancereported as creatinine in adults at physiological creatinineconcentrations. Enzymatic assays are available that are morespeci\ufb01c for creatinine and less susceptible to chemical and chromogenic (e.g., icterus and hemolysis) interferences.Although enzymatic methods are not totally immune to theinterferences affecting the Jaffe method and may be suscep-tible to other interferences speci \ufb01c to the enzymatic approach, in the majority of people, use of an enzymatic method willreduce the possibility of interference ( Table 12 127,196\u2013215). It is likely that cystatin C measurements will be less susceptible tochemical and spectral interferences affecting creatinine assays,but inevitably, interferences will surface with more extensiveclinical experience, for example, those due to circulatingantibodies that are seen with other immunoassays. 216\u2013218 After venipuncture, in unseparated samples, there is a gradual increase in measured SCr over time when the Jaffeassay is used. This effect is not seen when enzymatic assays areTable 11 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of GFR assessments using creatinine and cystatin C /C15Report eGFR in addition to the serum concentrations of \ufb01ltration markers using validated equations. /C15Report eGFR rounded to the nearest whole number and relative to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m2in adults using the units ml/min per 1.73 m2. /C15Reported eGFR levels <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2should be \ufb02agged as being low. /C15When reporting levels of \ufb01ltration markers, report: (i) SCr concentration rounded to the nearest whole number when expressed as standard international units ( mmol/l) and rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/dl); (ii) serum cystatin C concentration rounded to the nearest 100th of a whole number when expressed as conventional units (mg/l). /C15Measure \ufb01ltration markers using a speci \ufb01c, precise (coef \ufb01cient of variation [CV] <2.3% for creatinine and <2.0% for cystatin C) assay with calibration traceable to the international standard reference materials and desirable bias ( <3.7% for creatinine and <3.2% for cystatin C) compared with reference methodology (or appropriate international standard reference method group target in external quality assessment [EQA] for cystatin C). /C15Use an enzymatic method to assay creatinine, where possible. /C15Separate serum/plasma from red blood cells by centrifugation within 12 hours of venipuncture. /C15When cystatin C is measured, measure creatinine on the same sample to enable calculation of eGFRcr-cys. eGFR, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; eGFRcr-cys, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate based on creatinine and cystatin C; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; SCr, serum creatinine.

Further information may be found in Myers et al. 205chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S184 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 used.219We therefore advise that serum should be removed from the red blood cells within 12 hours of venipuncture when the Jaffe assay is being used. As described in Section 1.2, eGFR is an imperfect estimate of mGFR. At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% ofmGFR. As shown in Figure 12 , one of the sources of error is analytical variability in measurement of the \ufb01ltration markers. Optimization of laboratory measurements ofcreatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertaintyinherent in GFR estimation. The components ofmeasurement error that laboratories must address areaccuracy (trueness of the result), imprecision (analytical variability of the result, commonly expressed as a CV), and speci\ufb01city (reduction of interferences in the measurement). The availability of international reference standards for bothcreatinine 220and cystatin C221and demonstration that the laboratory results have minimal bias compared with thesehelp to ensure the accuracy of results. Imprecision targetsare commonly based on the known biological variability ofbiomarkers (https://biologicalvariation.eu/ ). Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biologicalvariability is generally considered desirable. 222The target CVs proposed here for creatinine and cystatin C should beachievable by automated laboratory methods. Achieving thetarget precision and bias goals proposed will ensure thatlaboratory error contributes to a less than 10% increase inroot mean square error when estimating GFR. 205 Most people with CKD, healthcare providers, and policy makers would want laboratories to implement calibrated as-says for creatinine and cystatin C that comply with interna-tional standards and use reagents for analysis that conform tointernationally approved reference materials. Compliancewith the recommended standards would ensure con \ufb01dence in the results and in clinical decisions and any changes inmanagement and treatment made as a consequence. Globally, most GFR estimates are currently produced using creatinine results generated by Jaffe assays, which are rela-tively inexpensive. Use of more speci \ufb01c enzymatic creatinine assays can improve the estimation of GFR. However, enzy-matic creatinine assays are more expensive than Jaffe assays.Use of cystatin C in combined creatinine-cystatin C GFRequations can also further improve GFR estimation, butcystatin C measurement adds signi \ufb01cantly to the cost. Although the per-patient cost increase of enzymatic creatinine and cystatin C measurement is relatively small, the imple- mentation of these more expensive approaches has signi \ufb01cant cost implications across entire healthcare systems. Implementation considerations include the following: Creatinine. Resource limitations that may restrict access to enzymatic creatinine should not be seen as a barrier toimplementation of a GFR reporting program based on Jaffecreatinine measurement. Cystatin C. Ideally, cystatin C will be available for timely same-day results, which requires either measurement withinthe local laboratory or alternatively as a referred test incentralized laboratories. A range of commercially availableroutine clinical biochemistry analyzers from a variety ofmanufacturers can support cystatin", "C assays and will allow turnaround time for results as rapid as that for routine electrolytes and creatinine when provided locally. Timelinesswill affect utilization (i.e., if results are available on the sameday), then the test is more likely to be useful for routine orurgent decisions, and this may increase the pressure on lab-oratories to provide this test locally. Estimated GFR. Implementation and modi \ufb01cation (e.g., a change in equation) of GFR estimation require close communication between the laboratory and a range of clinical users, including primary and secondary care healthcare pro-viders, pharmacists, dietitians, and people with CKD. 223 Laboratories should only use GFR estimating equations thathave been suf \ufb01ciently validated in the population to which they are being applied and that are appropriate for thecreatinine and cystatin C assays in use (Section 1.2.4 ). 223 They should also ensure that their end-to-end reporting processes, including calculations embedded within the laboratory information system, are subject to regular EQA.Laboratory reports for computed values should indicate the\ufb01ltration marker (i.e., eGFRcr, eGFRcys, and eGFRcr-cys).Documentation should indicate which equation was used. To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number ofmeaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach in relation to reporting units of GFR, creatinine, and cystatin C should be implemented. Input age may be rounded to wholenumbers or as a fractional year because the in \ufb02uence on eGFR is small. To adjust GFR for differences in body size,mGFR is commonly adjusted for body surface area (BSA),with a population average BSA value of 1.73 m 2being used. In practice, eGFR values derived using most equations arealready adjusted for BSA, because BSA was taken into account when the equations were originally developed using regres- sion modeling against BSA-adjusted mGFR. eGFR is mostly computed using the information recorded in the sex variable in EMRs. Some EMRs include legal sex, sexassigned at birth, and gender identity, whereas others includeonly one variable. In some cases, this variable may be missingor reported as nonbinary. In these cases, eGFR values cannotbe computed and will be displayed as a missing value. Lab- oratories should add a comment directing healthcare pro- viders and people with CKD to online calculators to facilitatea shared decision-making approach to the person with CKD.The comment may also include a suggestion to use cystatin Cas there is less difference between eGFRcys values for malesand females and where there is now an option for computingeGFR without the use of sex. Together, the set of statements allow for a consistent approach to the measurement and reporting of serum \ufb01ltra- tion markers and eGFR in clinical practice.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S185 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 1.2.3.3: Laboratories measuring creatinine in infants or small children must ensure their quality controlprocess include the lowest end of the expected range ofvalues for the group of interest. Practice Point 1.2.3.4: Consider the consistent use of enzymatic creatinine assays in children, given the higher relative contribution of non-creatinine chromogens to", "measured creatinine in children when using the Jaffe assay,and the high prevalence of icteric and hemolyzed samplesin the neonatal period. Practice Point 1.2.3.5: An eGFRcr level <90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2can be \ufb02agged as \u201clow\u201din children and adolescents over the age of 2 years. In the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease,1a cutoff of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2was chosen to de \ufb01ne\u201clow\u201d GFR for children. In this update, we advise increasing the cutoff to 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2for children and adolescents. In children and adolescents, a reduced GFR is likely to deteriorate further and, therefore, warrants closer monitoringand early intervention. Children with lower-than-normal GFRoften experience deterioration in GFR during periods of rapidgrowth in adolescence. 224Those with subnormal GFR during adolescence are more likely to eventually experience clinicallyimportant low GFR later in life. Even mild decreases ineGFR (i.e., CKD G2) are associated with poor kidneyoutcomes. In a US study of over 7 million children captured by electronic health record data, 8600 had CKD G2. At 10 years from cohort entry, the rate of reaching kidney failureor a 50% decline in eGFR ranged from around 10%(nonglomerular CKD) to around 40% (glomerular CKD). 225 Furthermore, eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is sometimes associated with impaired linear growth andwith hyperparathyroidism in children and adolescents. 226,227 A higher cutoff de \ufb01ning low GFR for children and ado- lescents also re \ufb02ects their longer life expectancy. Early inter- vention may have profound protection of GFR. CKD G2 haslong been considered to re \ufb02ect decreased GFR in children, re\ufb02ected by the inclusion of children and adolescents with CKD G2 in pediatric CKD trials and cohort studies, includingEffect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition onthe Progression of CRF in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE), 228 Hypertension Optimal Treatment in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease (HOT-KIDS; United Kingdom),229CKiD (North America),230KoreaN cohort study for outcomes in people with pediatric CKD (KNOW-PedCKD; South Korea),231and the Kids with CKD (KCAD; Australia and New Zealand).232The de \ufb01nition of CKD remains unchanged; the \ufb02agging of GFR <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2as low for children and adolescents re \ufb02ects the need for closer assessment for evidence of kidney damage and monitoring.1.2.4 Selection of GFR estimating equations Recommendation 1.2.4.1: We recommend using a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR from serum \ufb01ltration markers (eGFR) rather than relying on the serum \ufb01ltration markers alone (1D). Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as de \ufb01ned locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. The recommendation places a high value on the use of an estimating equation for GFR that has been validated in the population of interest and which has been shown to be most accurate in comparison with mGFR and a low value on the comparison of performance characteristics across differentequations. The key points are to use an equation validated inand most suited to", "the population of interest. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. This recommendation rec- ognizes that there are now a number of validated GFR esti-mating equations available. They have differing performance characteristics, which may differ depending on the population of interest. The intention of suggesting the use of the sameequation within a region is to reduce clinical confusion ifpeople with CKD go to different laboratories within a regionand to enable appropriate population comparisons. Use ofdifferent equations (and thus different eGFR values for thesame person) may lead to confusion for both the individualperson and their healthcare providers. The Work Group judged that there is potential for harm if people get different eGFR values when receiving care indifferent settings. As described in Section 1.2.2 ,t h e r ea r e several sources of variability in eGFR. Differences betweenvalid equations are often substantially less than these sourcesof variability, but that might not be understood by mosthealthcare providers or people, leading to excessive anxietyand repeated testing for small changes in GFR as related to the use of a different GFR estimating equation. Using the same equation within the same geographical region caneliminate the source of variation that is related to the speci \ufb01c parameters of the GFR estimating equation. There is bene \ufb01t to clinical care, research, and public health with the use of validated equations such that decisions,research \ufb01ndings, and public policy are informed by accurate estimates of CKD. Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on Work Group consensus regarding good clinical practice to usea GFR estimating equation validated in the population ofinterest. Table 13 lists criteria for validated equations. The criteria were developed by accumulated evidence from assessment of the performance of eGFR versus mGFR acrossequations and populations. For example, use of equationsdeveloped using assays that are not traceable to referencechapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S186 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 materials cannot be applied to settings with differences in assays,233or use of equations developed in one population may not perform well in other populations with verydifferent characteristics. 153,234,235 Values and preferences. There are now several valid equa- tions that can be reasonably used in local settings. The WorkGroup recognizes that different values and preferences maylead to different decisions in selection among validated GFR estimating equations. Thus, instead of being prescriptive, we list a set of criteria that de \ufb01nes a valid equation, a set of equations considered valid at this time, and a list of metrics tode\ufb01ne better versus worse performance as evaluated in the local area. It is of value that GFR thresholds for de \ufb01nition and staging be standardized using valid equations optimized for aspeci\ufb01c region helps to ensure this occurs. Where possible, inclusion of representation from key constituents in the population in the development of the equation and ensuring that it remains valid in those populations is also of value. Using validated eGFR equations improves the accuracy of assessment of true GFR but remains imperfect, and no singleequation performs consistently across all populations. The WorkGroup", "judged that people with CKD and their healthcare pro-viders would want GFR estimated using the equation providingthe greatest accuracy in the population of their geographical region. The Work Group recognizes that across the world there is signi\ufb01cant variation in the sociodemographic and ethnic makeup of populations and that even well-validated equationsdeveloped in different populations may not perform as well asothers developed and validated in the population of interest. Resource use and costs. There are a number of initial costs including human resource costs associated with taking the timeto decide on which equation, then time and technical infor- mation resources to be considered to change the computation, and the laboratory and nephrology teams to test the newequation and inform the clinical partners on the change. Inaddition, education for primary care providers, people withCKD, and other healthcare providers is also required, whichincurs both direct and indirect costs. There will be costs, bothhuman resource and meetings costs, associated with decision-making around which equation to use. Additional costs will beaccrued if validation and impact studies are required. Considerations for implementation. Each region should have a mechanism for review and selection of equations forimplementation by laboratories. For most countries, this might be through the national kidney society working in collaboration with laboratory physician organizations orregional laboratory groups, as has occurred in the UnitedStates and Europe, respectively. 236,237Decisions at this level by continental or national organizations are likely to minimizethe likelihood that decisions for equation use will be madewithin small geographical areas or governed by localdecisions, leading to greater variation in eGFR and uncertainty by people with CKD and healthcare providers. Considerations in decisions about implementation willre\ufb02ect the balance of the criteria listed in Table 13 . There are likely to be tradeoffs between optimal accuracy in local regions versus uniformity. Equations optimized for aspeci\ufb01c region can help to ensure that the GFR thresholds for disease de \ufb01nition, classi \ufb01cation, and risk estimation have the same implications across regions. However, it would lead to barriers to implementation, as it will not be possible for all regions to conduct a suf \ufb01ciently large and representative study to evaluate these equations and develop modi \ufb01cations. If not possible, or in the interim, we advise using equationsthat were developed in populations most similar to theavailable populations. For example, until more accurate re-gion-speci \ufb01c equations are available in countries within Central or South America, it may be reasonable to use CKD- EPI given the inclusion of Black and Hispanic participants in the development of equation, and within African countries, touse the EKFC equations using the Q-values, the median SCrconcentration in a cohort developed in 2 African countries. 234Table 13 | Criteria for a validated GFR estimating equation Criteria Consideration Developed using rigorous measured GFR (mGFR) methods; ideally using comparable measurements for all individuals in the development populationsDevelopment methods Developed using assays for \ufb01ltration markers traceable to reference materials with acceptable accuracy and imprecisionDevelopment methods Developed with suf \ufb01cient sample size for the population Development population Study populations with a wide", "range of clinical characteristics and GFR, where possible representative of the clinical populations in which equations are to be applied, including representative samples of general population and people with kidney diseaseDevelopment population Performance vs. mGFR evaluated in separate populations from that in which it was developed (i.e., external validation, not random split of development data)Accuracy Performance shows certain thresholds for performance compared with other equations (see Table 15 ) Accuracy Can be reported by laboratories (i.e., no other variables required for computation that are not readily available)Implementation by clinical laboratories GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S187 However, other considerations may also be relevant for the regional organization making these decisions. We also notethat if cystatin C is available, then using eGFRcr-cys wouldsimplify the selection of the equation as the performance of eGFRcr-cys computed from the different equations is more similar than that of eGFRcr. Rationale The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evalu-ation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease recom-mended \u201cto report eGFRcr in adults using the 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation. An alternative creatinine-based GFR estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown to improve accuracy of GFR estimates compared to the 2009CKD-EPI creatinine equation. \u201dWe are updating this recom- mendation to accommodate the availability of alternativeequations that also have high levels of accuracy. Since thepublication of the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guidelinefor the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-ease 1for GFR estimation in adults, there have been 3 main sources of validated equations: those developed by theCKD-EPI, those developed by EKFC, and modi \ufb01cations of each for use in speci \ufb01c regions ( Table 14 83,91,147,148,235,238\u2013 243).Table 15 lists thresholds for key performance metrics that can be used to guide comparison between equations. The CKD-EPI Research Group developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinine, cystatin C, and the combinationof both, with and without inclusion of a coef \ufb01cient for Black race. The concerns about the continued use of race in GFR thatled to the removal of the race coef \ufb01cient are described in the rationale that follows Practice Point 1.2.4.2. The 2009 CKD-EPIcreatinine equation includes creatinine, age, race, and sex. 238The 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation was re \ufb01tted without race and includes creatinine, age, and sex.147As a consequence of not including the Black race coef \ufb01cient, the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation leads to a small overestimate of GFR in non-Black individuals and a small underestimate in Black individuals. The 2009 CKD-EPI creatinine equation is moreaccurate than the 2021 CKD-EPI creatinine equation in thenon-Black race group, as indicated by the percentage of eGFRswithin 30% of mGFR (P 30), although the change in the level of accuracy is small compared with the known variability inmGFR and eGFR, and P 30remains at the level consistent with recommended targets as indicated in prior CKD guidelines (Table 1483,91,147,148,235,238\u2013 243Section 1.2.2, Figure 12174).1,147 The 2021 CKD-EPI eGFR creatinine-cystatin C equation that includes both \ufb01ltration markers but does not include a term for Black race", "leads to improved accuracy in both race groups,with less difference between race groups in all metrics. TheEKFC developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinineand cystatin C. 91,240Before implementation in other regions, the authors recommended that local regions specify population-speci \ufb01c Q-values for the creatinine-based EKFC equation, which is the normal level of creatinine in that region. T o make the SCr-based EKFC equation applicable for children,age-adjusted Q-values were de \ufb01ned. The original EKFCcreatinine equation had a Q-value developed from Belgiumand Sweden but was validated in 7 European studies and isrecommended for use in White Europeans. 240They have recently published Q-values for Black Europeans developed from a cohort of 90 kidney donors in Paris and for Black Africans developed from 2 cohorts in R\u00e9publiqueD\u00e9mocratique de Congo Cote D \u2019Ivoire. The EKFC cystatin C equation includes only age and cystatin C, that is, it does notinclude sex or race. The Q-value for cystatin C was developedin a White cohort in Uppsala, Sweden. The cystatin C \u2013based EKFC equation has been validated in White Europeans, BlackEuropeans, White Americans, and Black Africans. T o increase accuracy and precision, EKFC recommends averaging creatinine and cystatin C to obtain an estimate of GFR thatincludes both \ufb01ltration markers. eGFRcr-cys (the average of the EKFC creatinine and EKFC cystatin C) also provides themost accurate estimates, consistent with the \ufb01ndings of CKD- EPI eGFRcr-cys. In both the CKD-EPI and EKFC external validation data- sets, there are consistent \ufb01ndings that the eGFRcr-cys provides improved performance in estimating mGFR compared withthe respective creatinine- or cystatin-only equations. This re-inforces the recommendation in Section 1.2.1 emphasizing the greater use of eGFRcr-cys for decisions that require GFR. There have been several modi \ufb01cations to the CKD-EPI equations for use in individual countries, including China, Japan,and Pakistan. 83,153,235We expect country-speci \ufb01cm o d i \ufb01cations of both CKD-EPI and EKFC to continue to be developed. One recent study in China reported no clinically meaningful difference in the performance of the Asian-modi \ufb01ed CKD-EPI and EKFC equations compared with mGFR.244 Studies vary in their consistency and precision. Direct comparisons of available estimating equations in populationswith worldwide applicability are lacking, and so too arevalidation studies comparing equations against mGFR in allpopulations of interest. The overall certainty of the evidence is therefore low but where the performance characteristics of GFR estimating equations in the population of interest areknown, there are data to support the use of one equation overanother for improved accuracy of GFR reporting. Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided. Estimating equations for GFR have historically incorpo- rated demographic variables of age, sex, and race to explainvariation in serum concentrations of endogenous \ufb01ltration markers that are unrelated to GFR, thereby minimizing sys-tematic errors in subgroups de \ufb01ned by these variables and systematic differences between groups. Age, sex, and race variables were included in the 2009 CKD-EPI equation as previous studies indicated higheraverage SCr for the same mGFR level in people who are older versus younger, males versus females, and", "people who are Black versus non-Black. Incorporation of these variablesminimized systematic errors in groups and systematic dif-ferences between groups. 147,245Similarly, subsequent to thechapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S188 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Table 14 | Validated GFR estimating equations MarkerEquation name and year Age Variables Development populations Creatinine CKD-EPI 2009238$18; modi \ufb01cation CKD-EPI 40 for pediatric availableDeveloped using A, S, R but reported not using the Blackrace coef \ufb01cient, A, S, R (NB)8254 Black and NB individuals from 10 studies in the United States and Europe a CKiD U25 20212391\u201325 A, S, height 928 children with CKD in the United States and Canada CKD-EPI 2021147$18 A, S 8254 Black and NB individuals from 10 studies in the United States and Europea EKFC 20212402\u2013100 A, S, European Black and NB speci \ufb01c Q-value; separate Q-values for Africa vs. EuropemGFR vs. SCr (11,251 participants in 7 studies in Europe and 1 study from the United States) Normal GFR from 5482 participants in 12 studies of kidney donor candidates (100% Caucasian) European NB Q from 83,157 laboratory samples (age 2 \u201340 years) in 3 European hospital clinical laboratories; European Black Q-value (N \u00bc90 living kidney donors from Paris); African BlackQ-value (N \u00bc470 healthy individuals from R\u00e9publique D\u00e9mocratique de Congo); AllQ-values developed in cohorts independent for EKFC development and validation Lund Malm\u00f6 Revised 2014 241A, S 3495 GFR examinations from 2847 adults from Sweden referred for measurement of GFR CKD-EPI 2009 Modi \ufb01ed for China 2014b,242$18 A, S 589 people with diabetes from the Third Af \ufb01liated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China CKD-EPI 2009 Modi \ufb01ed for Japan 2016b,83$18 A, S 413 hospitalized Japanese people in 80 medical centers CKD-EPI 2009 Modi \ufb01ed for Pakistan 2013b,235$18 A, S 542 randomly selected low- to middle-income communities in Karachi and 39 people from the kidney clinic Cystatin C CKD-EPI 2012148$18 A, S 5352 Black and NB individuals from 13 studies in the United States and Europe EKFC 20239118\u2013100 A mGFR vs. SCys (assumed to be the same as mGFR vs. SCr) Normal GFR (same as for the SCr equation)Q from laboratory samples from 227,643 (42% female) laboratory samples from UppsalaUniversity Hospital, Sweden CAPA 2014 243A, S 4690 individuals within large subpopulations of children and Asian and Caucasian adults Creatinine- cystatin CCKD-EPI 2012148$18 Developed using A, S, R but reported not using the Blackrace coef \ufb01cient, A, S, R (NB)5352 Black and NB individuals from 13 studies in the United States and Europe CKD-EPI 2021 147$18 A, S 5352 Black and NB individuals from 13 studies in the United States and Europe Average of EKFC cr and cys240$2 A, S, European race speci \ufb01c Q-value; separate Q-valuesfor Africa vs. EuropeSee above for EKFC creatinine and cystatin C A, age; CAPA, Caucasian and Asian pediatric and adult subjects; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKD-EPI, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration; CKiD, chronic kidney disease in children; cr, creatinine; cys, cystatin C; EKFC, European Kidney Function Consortium; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; mGFR, measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; NB, non-Black; Q", "values, median level of serum creatinine or cystatin C in a given population without chronic kidney disease; R, race; S, sex; SCr, serum creatinine; SCys, serum cystatin C; U25, under 25 years old. aAlso included 100 Asians and 353 Hispanic or Native Americans. bModi \ufb01ed from CKD-EPI or MDRD; modi \ufb01cations may re \ufb02ect systematic differences in measurement of creatinine and mGFR as well as population differences in non-GFR determinants of creatinine.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S189 initial publication, the EKFC equation also included as separate Q-values, the median SCr concentration for BlackEuropeans from Paris and Africans from Cote D \u2019Ivoire and Democratic Republic of the Congo. 91 Race differs from age and sex, as race (and ethnicity) is dy- namic, shaped by geographic, cultural, and sociopolitical forces,and thus the de \ufb01nition can change across geography and over time. 246,247Consistent with this, in the past several years, inclusion of race in GFR estimating equations, along withother algorithms in medicine, faced increasing scrutiny,particularly in the United States but also elsewhere in theworld. 248\u2013254Concerns included, \ufb01rst, race is a social and not a biological construct, and thus the de \ufb01nition of a race group is subject to change over time. Second, using a binary variable toassign race groups ignores social and biological diversity withinand among people with similar racial background groups.Third, there are differences across countries and regions inself-reported race and ethnicity, thus leading to uncertainty asto how to apply the term, and blanket use can lead to error. Thus, even though the inclusion of an indicator for race group leads to improved accuracy compared with mGFR in some studies, these concerns and other considerations led to the 2021 recommendation for it not to be used in the computationof eGFR in the United States. 255Other countries have also recognized that race should not be included in computationand elected to use the CKD-EPI 2009 age, sex, race \u2013non- Black, as the population of people who are Black wassuf\ufb01ciently small to not warrant error for other groups. 236,256 We recognize that speci \ufb01c countries or regions (e.g., Japan and Thailand) have developed \u201cregion-speci \ufb01c\u201dequations.153 We advocate for modifying equations based on the populationbeing tested. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children usingvalidated equations that have been developed or validatedin comparable populations.Examples of validated equations include the CKiD under 25 years old (U25) 2021 eGFRcr equation, the EKFC, and theCKD-EPI40. The Work Group judged that many healthcareproviders would choose the CKiD U25 2021 eGFRcr equation given it was derived in a multiracial cohort of children with CKD and has been externally validated in cohorts with reducedand normal GFR. The performance of the CKiD U25 2021eGFRcr equation is uncertain in the very young, those with verylow GFR, or in populations outside of Europe and NorthAmerica. 257An alternative height/sex/age/creatinine-based GFR estimating equation is acceptable if it has been shown toimprove accuracy of GFR estimates in the population of interest ( Table 14 83,91,147,148,235,238\u2013243). The EKFC equation has been", "validated in a large cohort of European children (N \u00bc1254), as well as in adults.240Of interest, the EKFC equation in children is the same as in adults. Thus, bothCKiD U25 and EKFC allow a GFR estimation for childrenwith CKD without changes in calculated eGFR at thetransition between adolescence and young adulthood. Inchildren with neurological disorders, muscle wasting, or who have metabolic disorders and are on a very low \u2013protein diet, a cystatin C \u2013based equation is likely more appropriate. 1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria Albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine (urine ACR $30 mg/g or $3 mg/mmol). Albumin is one type of plasma protein found in the urine in normal subjects andin larger quantity in people with kidney disease. In the KDIGO2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation andManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease, 1clinical terminology was changed to focus on albuminuria rather than proteinuriaas albumin is the principal component of urinary protein in most kidney diseases. Epidemiologic data demonstrate a strong relationship between the quantity of urine albumin with bothkidney and CVD risk and observed CVD even at very lowlevels, and assays to measure albumin are more precise andsensitive than assays to measure urine protein. We refer toalbuminuria or urine albumin when discussing generalconcepts and will refer either to total protein, albumin, or otherspeci\ufb01c proteins when discussing that parameter speci \ufb01cally. 1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for initial testing of albuminuria (in descending order of prefer- ence). In all cases, a \ufb01rst void in the morning midstream sample is preferred in adults and children. (i)urine ACR, or (ii)reagent strip urinalysis for albumin and ACR withautomated reading. If measuring urine protein, use the following measurements: (i)urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR), (ii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein with auto-mated reading, or (iii)reagent strip urinalysis for total protein withmanual reading.Table 15 | Criteria for equation comparison for comparison of candidate equations to another (i.e., how to determine validity) Criteria Consideration Systematic error (bias): absolute magnitude of the absolute value of the median difference \u00bcmedian (eGFR \u2013mGFR)Small<5 Moderate 5 \u201310 Large>10 Precision: IQR of the difference between eGFR and mGFRSmall<10 Moderate 10 \u201320 Large>20 Accuracy: P 30(percentage of estimates within 30% of mGFR)Optimal $90 Acceptable 80 \u201390 Poor<80 eGFR, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; IQR, interquartile range; mGFR, measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.

Equations that have large error (bias) or IQR, or low P 30have poor performance.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S190 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Practice Point 1.3.1.2: Use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected using less accurate methods. /C15Con\ufb01rm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or pro- teinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement andexpress as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible(i.e., quantify the ACR or PCR if initial semiquantitativetests are positive). /C15Con\ufb01rm ACR \u202130 mg/g ( \u20213 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent \ufb01rst morning void in the morning midstream", "urine sample. Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affectinterpretation of measurements of urine albumin andurine creatinine and order con \ufb01rmatory tests as indicated (Table 16 ). The practice point advocating for the use of spot samples measuring albumin or protein greatly facilitates its incorpo-ration into clinical practice by avoiding the need for timedurine collections. Such spot samples can over- or underesti-mate urine albumin due to variation in dilution. Use of ACRor protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) in spot urine samplescan decrease this error. ACR is an estimate of total urine al-bumin loss. The creatinine excretion rate varies substantially between people. ACR or PCR will overestimate urine albumin loss in people with low creatinine excretion and will under-estimate urine albumin or protein loss in people with veryhigh creatinine excretion. The decision by prior guideline Work Groups not to have a sex-speci \ufb01c threshold and to use easy-to-remember values regardless of units may also lead to some misclassi \ufb01cation. On balance, the current Work Group agrees with this approach given the continued underutilization of urine albumin in the assessment of CKD. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measure- ment with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric(effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to bemissed. The signi \ufb01cance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. 258\u2013261 In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Urine albumin measurementprovides a more speci \ufb01c and sensitive measure of changes in glomerular permeability than urinary total protein. 262\u2013264 There is evidence that urinary albumin is a more sensitive testto enable the detection of glomerular pathology associatedwith some other systemic diseases including diabetes, hy-pertension, and systemic sclerosis. 265\u2013268 T otal protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations \u2014relatively large increases in urine albumin loss can occur without causing asigni\ufb01cant measurable increase in urinary total protein, 264large sample-to-sample variation in the amount and composition ofproteins, high and variable concentrations of non \u2013protein interfering substances relative to the protein concentration,and high inorganic ion content. Most laboratories currentlyuse either turbidimetry or colorimetry 269to measure total protein. These methods do not give equal analytical speci \ufb01city and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency269\u2013271to react more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other non-albumin proteins,272\u2013275and many have signi \ufb01cant interferences causing falsely high results.275\u2013277There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement(https://jctlm.org/ ). The variety of methods and calibrants in use means that there is inevitably signi \ufb01cant between- laboratory variation. 278\u2013280 Studies examining the diagnostic accuracy of tests to quantify urine albumin and other proteins usually comparetests with laboratory quanti \ufb01cation from 24-hour urine col- lections. It is generally recognized that a 24-hour sample is thede\ufb01nitive means of demonstrating the presence ofTable 16 | Factors causing biological variation in urine albumin or urine protein Factor Falsely elevated ACR or PCR False decrease in ACR or PCR Variability in urine albumin or protein Hematuria Increases albumin and protein", "in the urine Menstruation Increases albumin and protein in the urine Exercise259Increases albumin and protein in the urine Infection260,261Symptomatic urinary infection can cause production of protein from the organism Nonalbumin proteins Other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips Variability in urinary creatinine concentration Biological sex Females have lower urinary creatinine excretion, therefore higher ACR and PCRMales have higher urinary creatinine excretion, therefore lower ACR and PCR Weight73,160Low urinary creatinine excretion consistent with low weight can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretionHigh urinary creatinine excretion consistent with high weight can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion Changes in creatinine excretionLower urinary creatinine excretion with AKI or low-protein intakeHigh urinary creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise ACR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio; AKI, acute kidney injury; PCR, protein-to-creatinine ratio.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S191 albuminuria. However, timed samples are often collected with error. Overnight, \ufb01rst void in the morning, second void in the morning, or random sample collections are therefore rec-ommended as \ufb01rst-line tests. 281,282Because creatinine excretion in the urine is fairly constant throughout the 24-hour period, the measurement of ACR (or PCR) allowscorrection for variations in urinary concentration. 283,284 ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement of urinealbumin loss. 285\u2013290PCR on random or early morning untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance andcorrelation with 24-hour collection. 281,291\u2013298 We acknowledge that reagent strip devices can have a role in settings where access to laboratory services may be limited(see Section 1.4). Implementation of \ufb01rst morning voids will be dif \ufb01cult to obtain in most healthcare settings. Nephrology of \ufb01ces could develop protocols to send people with CKD home with aurine collection container and instruction on how to obtain aclean catch, which the person brings back before their nextvisit. Alternatively, obtaining blood and urine tests before the next visit can facilitate \ufb01rst morning voids. However, in the absence of a \ufb01rst morning void, a random sample may still be used. Negative \ufb01ndings in people at high risk for CKD, for example, where the urine sample is diluted, can be con \ufb01rmed with a subsequent \ufb01rst morning void. Positive \ufb01ndings in people at low risk for CKD, where the ACR level is just above the threshold where the urine samples are concentrated, canalso be con \ufb01rmed with a \ufb01rst morning void. The numeric equivalence of ACR in mg/g (mg/mmol) to approximately g/d is based on the simple assumption thatcreatinine excretion rate (CER) approximates 1 gram/d (10mmol/d). T o better estimate urine albumin in individuals withcreatinine generation that is very different from the average, onemight consider measuring a timed urine collection if the valuewould affect clinical decisions. As with assessment of GFR usingmeasured CrCl, use supervised urine collections. Alternatively, equations are available that estimate creatinine generation from prediction equations and then multiply that value by the ACR tocompute an estimated albumin excretion rate (AER) that ac-commodates the lower or higher level of CER. 299,300 Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended because it is relatively standardized", "and because it is the single mostimportant protein lost in the urine in most CKDs. Use ofurinary albumin measurement as the preferred test for pro- teinuria detection will improve the sensitivity, quality, and consistency of approach to the early detection and manage-ment of kidney disease. Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insuf \ufb01ciently sensitive for the reliable detection of proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and areonly semiquantitative. Furthermore, there is no standardizationbetween manufacturers. The use of such strips should be discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria, or validated point-of-care de-vices for urine albumin/ACR (Section 1.4). When used, reagent strip results should be con \ufb01rmed by laboratory testing.Although the reference point remains the accurately timed 24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a dif \ufb01cult procedure to control effectively and that inaccuracies in urinarycollection may contribute to errors in estimation of albumin and/or protein losses. In practice, untimed urine samples are a reasonable \ufb01rst test for ascertainment of albuminuria. A \ufb01rst morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion, has relatively lowintraindividual variability, and is required to exclude thediagnosis of orthostatic (postural) proteinuria. A random urinesample is acceptable if no \ufb01rst morning void sample is available. The concentration of albumin or protein in a urine sample will be affected by hydration (i.e., how diluted or concentrated a urine sample is), and reporting the albumin or protein to thecreatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration andreduce intraindividual variability. 205,261,301,302 There is biological and analytical variability in urine albu- min and urine protein loss. There are several biological factorsthat affect urine albumin or protein loss, separate from kidneydisease ( Table 16 ). 259All of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression. Thus, positive tests should becon\ufb01rmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Large changes would be repeated to con \ufb01rm increasing urine albumin and urine protein. Chapter 2 discusses themagnitude of change to be considered a real change given theknown biological and analytical variability. There is also biological variability in urine creatinine excretion. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss. In general, urine creatinine mea-surements are less susceptible to factors that interfere withSCr assays. If a more accurate quanti \ufb01cation of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin ortotal protein in a timed collection under supervised condi-tions as recommended above. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 1.3.1.4: In children, obtain a \ufb01rst morning urine sample for initial testing of albuminuria and pro-teinuria (in descending order of preference): (i)Both urine PCR and urine ACR, (ii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and foralbumin with automated reading, or (iii)Reagent strip urinalysis for total protein and foralbumin with manual reading. Consistent with the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of ChronicKidney Disease, 1PCR is advised and preferred as initial screening for", "children as the majority of children haveunderlying developmental abnormalities often referred to asCAKUT and a much higher proportion of children than adults have tubular pathology. 303Testing for ACR may miss tubular proteinuria. However, testing exclusively for proteinuria does not allow characterization of the source. Ifurine PCR is used, urine ACR should also be measured tochapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S192 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 better characterize proteinuria. Signi \ufb01cant albuminuria generally re \ufb02ects glomerular damage.304Importantly, in the context of screening for children with diabetes, ACR remains the standard, in line with adult guidelines. The same considerations of using \ufb01rst morning samples (because of orthostatic proteinuria) and considering tran-siently increased proteinuria during intercurrent illness orafter exercise apply to children as well as adults. Orthostaticproteinuria is estimated to affect 2% \u20135% of adolescents. 305 Age and body size are important for interpreting proteinuria and albuminuria. In term and preterm neonates, PCR is high(PCR 1000 \u20133000 mg/g [100 \u2013300 mg/mmol]) in the \ufb01rst days and weeks of life, and is related to glomerular and tubular lossesof protein from immature nephrons, as well as very low creati-nine from low muscle mass. Recent studies outline proteinuriaranges for neonates, including for preterm and low-birth-weightneonates. As the tubules mature, proteinuria slowly declines. Ingeneral, a PCR of <500 mg/g ( <50 mg/mmol) (or a 24-hour protein of <150 mg/m 2/d) is considered normal for infants aged 6 months to 2 years. For children over 2 years, a \ufb01rst morning urine PCR of <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) protein, or <150 mg/ m2/d, or a \ufb01rst morning urine ACR <30 mg/g ( <3m g / m m o l )i s usually considered normal.83,306\u2013309More comprehensive values can be found in Pediatric Nephrology .310 1.3.2 Guidance to clinical laboratories The following comments are focused on the laboratoryassessment of albuminuria, rather than total proteinuria, givenalbumin measurement is the preferred approach to proteinuriaevaluation (Section 1.3.1. ) However, some of these practice points (sample type and storage, reporting as a PCR) would apply equally to total protein measurement practices. Practice Point 1.3.2.1: Implement the laboratory reporting and handling standards outlined in Table 17 to ensure accuracy and reliability of the \ufb01ndings when assessing urine samples. Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferredpractice for laboratories. Adoption of the reporting and handling standards for assessment of urine samples is of paramount importance toensure that healthcare providers receive urine ACR reports ina consistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracyand reliability of the result. Measurement of urine albumin for the detection of kidney disease as with any analyte should be with methodologytraceable to international standards using a standard referencematerial. This is currently not the case, and results may varyby greater than 40% between laboratories depending on themethodology used with attendant impact on the interpreta-tion of reported results. The type of urine collection and the analytical method in\ufb02uence result interpretation. Twenty-four-hour urine col- lections present problems in terms of completeness", "ofcollection, specimen storage, and timing accuracy. Therefore,the assessment of ACR from a single void is a common andconvenient clinical practice. The ACR accounts for hydrationand has similar diagnostic performance to 24-hour urineAER. The collection method should remain consistent, pref-erably using the \ufb01rst morning void specimen. If specimens are being stored for future analysis, careful attention must be paid to the storage conditions to avoiddegradation of albumin leading to quanti \ufb01cation error. The re- ported effects of frozen storage on urine albumin are somewhatinconsistent. Albumin is generally stable in urine stored at 2 /C14C\u20138 /C14C for 7 days. However, losses of albumin have been reported when urine is stored frozen at temperatures higher than /C080/C14C. Precipitates often form when urine is stored refrigerated orfrozen but can be redissolved on warming: samples should be warmed to room temperature and mixed before analysis. 290 Albumin losses may be affected by factors including period of storage, sample albumin concentration, and individualvariation. 311It should be possible to provide refrigerated storage and process samples for albumin measurement in alaboratory within 7 days in most healthcare settings. The internationally accepted laboratory quality standards are variably met worldwide, and laboratories are at different levels with respect to quality. However, the Work Group placed a high value on the accuracy and reliability of quanti \ufb01cation of albuminuria and judged that people with CKD, their healthcareproviders, and policy makers would want laboratories to ach-ieve these reporting and handling standards. The direct costs of total protein measurement in urine are lower than those of urine albumin. However, total proteinmeasurement lacks sensitivity for the detection of low but clinically signi \ufb01cant levels of albuminuria. For this, and other reasons discussed in Section 1.3.1 , the measurement of ACR is preferred to that of PCR. Urine albumin should be measured using immunological assays capable of speci \ufb01cally and precisely quantifying albu- min at low concentrations and of producing quantitative re- sults over the clinically relevant range. The biologicalvariation of urine albumin exceeds 60%. Target analytical variation (CV) should be based on an optimal level of <0.25 biological variation, approximately 15%. This is in keeping with good practice recommendations from the NationalAcademy of Clinical Biochemistry. 312Table 17 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of urine samples /C15Samples for albumin measurement analyzed fresh or stored at 4/C14C for up to 7 days /C15Samples for albumin measurement should not be stored frozen at/C020/C14C /C15Report ACR in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone /C15Reporting to 1 decimal place for ACR whether mg/mmol or mg/g /C15Analytical CV of methods to measure urine albumin should be <15%.

Laboratories should ensure that they are enrolled and demonstratesatisfactory performance", "in, an EQA scheme for urinealbumin, creatinine, and ACR. Urine albumin (and protein) concentrations in urine should be reported as a ratio to creatinine \u2014ACR (or PCR). Reporting as a ratio to creatinine corrects for variations inurinary \ufb02ow rate and enables reporting on untimed, spot samples, obviating the need for timed, including 24-hour,collections, which are prone to collection error and tediousfor people to undertake. Reporting albumin as a ratio tocreatinine reduces the intraindividual variability in albumin-uria compared with reporting as albumin concentration alone(mg/mmol or mg/g). 315 To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number of meaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach should be used in relation to reporting units of ACR and PCR. ACRresults should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol)or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assaysare generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine inurine, although high concentrations of glucose can interferein Jaffe urine creatinine measurement and produce clinicallymeaningful errors in ACR. 1.4 Point-of-care testing Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of- care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine andurine albumin measurement where access to a lab- oratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of- care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the samepreanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteriarelating to the specimen collection and performance of thedevice, including external quality assessment, and the interpretation of the result is used. Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use theequation consistent with that used within the region. Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices to produce a positiveresult in 85% of people with signi \ufb01cant albuminuria (ACR \u202130 mg/g or \u20213 mg/mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device.This recommendation places a high value on the advantages of POCTs including convenience, elimination of sample trans-portation to the central laboratory, minimal sample processing,simple analytic process, minimal sample requirement, and im- mediate availability of results. It places a lower value on the limited and heterogeneous data related to their diagnosticaccuracy. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. POCTs for both creatinine and urine albumin have several potential bene \ufb01ts. POCT may lead to earlier diagnosis, and as a result, earlier treatment ofCKD. They may also be used to monitor CKD progression,which enables more timely treatment decisions. The rapidreporting, low cost, and convenience to people with CKDcompared with central laboratory testing are also important bene\ufb01ts of POCTs. However, its provision can raise challenges in relation to maintenance of analytical and diagnostic per- formance, and governance arrangements. In addition, thesetests may be less accurate than laboratory testing, which maylead to misdiagnosis, misclassi \ufb01cation, overtreatment, or undertreatment. The balance of bene \ufb01ts and", "harms needs rigorous evaluation speci \ufb01c to each clinical situation. For creatinine, the ERT identi \ufb01ed a systematic review from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE)/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) diagnosticguideline that evaluated point-of-care creatinine tests to assessGFR before computed tomography (CT) scanning withcontrast media. 316The ERT also updated the \ufb01ndings of this systematic review. The review from NICE/NIHR identi \ufb01ed and qualitatively synthesized data from 54 studies ondiagnostic accuracy: eGFR diagnostic accuracy (n \u00bc12), SCr diagnostic accuracy (n \u00bc7), and correlation and bias of POC creatinine tests compared with laboratory-basedtests (n \u00bc50). One study 317was identi \ufb01ed in the update of the NICE/NIHR review assessing POC creatinine testcompared with laboratory standards in a pediatricpopulation with malaria in Uganda. These studies covered 3 types of devices: StatSensor, i- STAT, and ABL devices. In general, all 3 devices demonstrated acceptable accuracy at lower levels of eGFR (< 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2).316Results showed that i-STAT and ABL devices may have higher probabilities of correctly classifying people in the same eGFR categories as the laboratory reference thanStatSensor devices. For albumin, the ERT identi \ufb01ed a systematic review pub- lished in 2014, by McTaggart et al. , 318that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative protein or albumin urine dipstick tests compared with laboratory-based tests among people with suspected ordiagnosed CKD. The ERT included relevant studies fromthis review and conducted an update. Sixty- \ufb01ve studies (in 66 articles) 319\u2013344,345\u2013368,369\u2013384eval- uated the accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative pro-tein or albumin dipstick tests in a general population not onchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S194 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 KRT or receiving end-of-life care. Studies addressed the following critical outcomes: measurement bias (n \u00bc1), analytical variability (n \u00bc5), analytical sensitivity (n \u00bc2), and analytic speci \ufb01city (n \u00bc63) (Supplementary Table S5336,347,363,372,373,377,382\u2013384). Speci \ufb01city ranged from 17.5 to 99.5 when evaluative ACR $30 mg/g ($ 3 mg/mmol) and 30.0\u201398.7 when evaluative ACR $300 mg/g ($ 30 mg/ mmol). For PCR, speci \ufb01city ranged from 80.8 \u201396.9 when evaluative PCR >200 mg/g (> 20 mg/mmol) and 75.6 \u201395.2 when evaluative PCR >500 mg/g ( >50 mg/mol). The evidence regarding the performance of POCT for creatinine and urine albumin is heterogeneous limiting the determination of overall \ufb01ndings across these critical out- comes. However, given the cost-effectiveness bene \ufb01ts, avail- ability of the test in the absence of laboratory studies, and the acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that inspeci\ufb01c clinical scenarios, POCT should be used. Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence for POCT for creatinine testing was rated as low due to consistentreporting of reference standards across all outcomes, with some concerns regarding patient selection and \ufb02ow and timing and directness of the evidence. The certainty of evi- dence regarding performance of all POCT for urine albuminwas very low based on the Quality Assessment of DiagnosticAccuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) assessment of individualstudies due to sparse data, heterogeneous \ufb01ndings, and con- cerns about patient selection, index tests, and unclearreporting of the reference", "standards. Values and preferences. The recommendation suggested that the majority of people with CKD who have limited accessto laboratories would choose to use POCT. These tests mayfacilitate people with CKD being seen at home or in remotesettings. Many people with CKD will value the immediateresults available with POCT versus waiting for the tests from alab. In addition, some people with CKD will place a highervalue on avoiding expensive lab tests that may not be covered by their insurance, dif \ufb01cult travel to central healthcare facil- ities, and exposure to infection risk in hospital. These people with CKD may also place a lower value on the potentialinaccuracies associated with POCTs compared with in-centerlaboratory testing. Resource use and costs. For people with CKD, the use of POCTs may be less expensive than tests conducted in aclinical laboratory. In areas with limited access to healthcare and insurance, these tests may be cost saving and increase the detection for CKD. 385,386For the healthcare system, some direct reagent and staff costs of POCT tend to be higher ona per test basis than those of centralized laboratory testing,but these costs may be offset by other savings in the clinicalpathway, for example, through more rapid disease detectionor avoidance of hospital referral. Considerations for implementation. POCTs may not be available everywhere. Support from the local laboratory ser- vice should be sought to guide the purchase, evaluation, implementation, governance, and ongoing quality assuranceof POCT. The ability to test creatinine in a person \u2019s home may have applicability to \u201cvirtual ward \u201dsettings (hospital at home). It is worth noting that for albuminuria testing, the Na- tional Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has proposed thatdevices should have 95% sensitivity for the detection of albuminuria. 312This is not always achieved by POCT devices, especially those that produce semiquantitative results.318 Rationale POCT can be carried out in a wide range of settings including primary care, community clinics, rural communities, andsecondary care supporting timely diagnosis, monitoring, andtreatment. Importantly, in locations where laboratory services may be limited or nonexistent (e.g., rural and remote com- munities), the ability to test versus not testing blood andurine was important. Advantages of POCT include conve-nience, elimination of sample transportation to the centrallaboratory, minimal sample processing because the analysis isof whole blood/urine, simple analytic process, minimalsample requirement, and immediate availability of results.However, these tests may be prone to errors and inaccuracies. For these reasons, the recommendation suggests the use of these tests based on the speci \ufb01c clinical need or geographical/ social circumstances. Use of POCT may facilitate access to earlier diagnosis and, thus, care and can be implemented in rural and remote lo-cations. The value of POCT for currently underserved pop-ulations cannot be overstated and should include the capacityfor generating creatinine-based eGFR equations. The POCT devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and urine for albumin and creatinine to measure ACR and bestandardized and calibrated with similar rigor as is recom-mended for laboratory tests. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. The ability to use a small sample volume, \ufb01ngerprick sample as", "opposed to venipuncture, may have applicability to testing in children.

Monitoring CKD through the surveillance of albuminuria and GFR serves to update staging for prognosis, identifytiming of intervention strategies, and assess the effectivenessof speci \ufb01c treatments. No clear threshold de \ufb01nes a clinically relevant change in GFR or albuminuria, as any worseningcould re \ufb02ect deterioration in kidney health. However, over- interpretation of small changes in these measures may lead tounnecessary changes in clinical management that could beunhelpful or even deleterious. Education for healthcare pro- viders and people with CKD about the variability of speci \ufb01c laboratory measurements in kidney disease is important to facilitate understanding and to mitigate inappropriatechanges in treatment strategies due to nonclinically signi \ufb01cant \ufb02uctuations in either positive or negative directions. There is an expected variability in GFR caused by both biological and analytical factors of the biomarkers used(Figure 12 ). We have chosen to consider the 95% CI of test reproducibility for both eGFR and ACR as an importantfactor for determining thresholds for clinical evaluation.The initial evaluation of an observed change in either eGFRor ACR should be to repeat the test(s) so as to determine ifthe observed change is clinically signi \ufb01cant progression of CKD or is within biological and analytical variability of thetest. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Monitoring of children in the per- ipubescent phase should be undertaken more frequently thanthe CKD stage \u2013based recommended frequency of monitoring as puberty is a period of high risk of progression. 387Reasons for this are incompletely understood, but potentialmechanisms include inability of diseased kidneys to undergothe hypertrophy needed to accompany the rapid somatic growth that characterizes puberty and the negative effect of increased levels of sex steroids. 388A study of over 900 children with CKD due to CAKUT showed a decline thatwas>10 times faster in creatinine-based eGFR after the period of peak growth than before that period. 388The CKiD study (including children with CKD of any cause) showedmore rapid declines in both eGFR (creatinine- and cystatinC\u2013based) and mGFR after the period of peak growth velocity than before. 387Frequency of monitoring should beindividualized, and informed by the severity of CKD, stage of puberty, and observed recent rate of progression. Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progressionwhen measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Previous guidelines have suggested the routine monitoring of albuminuria and GFR. Prior guidelines have suggestedannual monitoring for those with CKD G1 \u2013G2, every 6 months for those with CKD G3, every 3 months for CKD G4, and every 6 weeks for CKD G5 disease. Given the greater risk of disease progression, those with higher risk of diseaseprogression should", "undergo more frequent monitoring(Figure 13 29). More frequent monitoring may be indicated in people with changing clinical status, intercurrent events, andafter therapeutic interventions to assess response andadherence and ensure safety. In addition, progression riskmay vary by the etiology of CKD within a speci \ufb01c stage based on GFR and albuminuria or proteinuria. Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Within-subject variation in measured and eGFR is well described (Figure 12 ). Thus, the ability to distinguish between biological and analytical versus pathological variation in themGFR and eGFR is important for healthcare providers and people with CKD. Studies show that intraindividual biological variation in eGFR is similar across eGFRequations: CKD-EPI-creatinine (5.3% [4.5% \u20136.4%]), CKD- EPI-cystatin C (5.3% [4.5% \u20136.5%]), and CKD-EPI- creatinine-cystatin C (5.0% [4.3% \u20136.2%]). The reference change value (RCV) is de \ufb01ned as the threshold of change that differs from the individual\u2019 s prior value with 95% CI; in a cohort of people with CKD, eGFRcr and eGFRcys had RCVs ranging from 14% \u201320% in the positive and negative directions. Although attention to progressive loss of eGFR is important, smaller changes in GFR may not be related totrue changes in kidney health, especially if transient andrequire cautious interpretation. Thresholds for CKD progression used in clinical trials and epidemiological studies are different than those suggested formonitoring of people with CKD. In research studies, 30% \u2013 40% declines in GFR have been associated with increased riskfor kidney failure, and treatment effects on these endpointshave been associated with changes in risk for kidney failure.Because these are evaluated at the group level, small errors inindividual people with CKD are minimized.chapter 2 www.kidney-international.org S196 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Practice Point 2.1.4: Among people with CKD who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, GFR reductions of>30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation. Acute eGFR decline after intensive BP control has been observed in people with CKD, with reductions of 10% \u201320% being typical within the \ufb01rst 3 months of treatment. These declines in eGFR are hemodynamically mediated, represent-ing a response to BP falling below the lower threshold of aperson \u2019s autoregulatory response. For many, this initial decline in eGFR is transient and will stabilize or resolve overtime, as resetting of the autoregulatory function occurs. Thus,acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of <20%\u201330% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents, which may be important for cardio- and kidney-protective effects in the long term. This phenomenon is especiallycommon when using ACEi/angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARBs), as they both lower BP and alter arteriolar \ufb02ow through the glomeruli, and SGLT2i through similar hemo-dynamic mechanisms. Post hoc analyses of trials of SGLT2i treatment in people with diabetes, heart failure, and CKD suggested that participants with>10% initial drop in eGFR have similar eGFR trajectories and kidney bene \ufb01ts from SGLT2i compared with the\u201cnondipper \u201dwho received SGLT2i, except in unusual cases when the acute \u201cdip\u201din", "eGFR was >30% from baseline. 389,390 These \ufb01ndings were consistent across all subgroups. A signi \ufb01cant drop in eGFR (> 30%) while initiating anti- hypertensive agents, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or SGLT2i should prompt a review into other causes and war- rants close monitoring. However, healthcare providers shouldavoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents,particularly because these earlier \u201cdips\u201dare typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity. Practice Point 2.1.5: For albuminuria monitoring of people with CKD, a doubling of the ACR on a subsequent test exceeds laboratory variability and warrants evaluation. Small \ufb02uctuations in albuminuria or proteinuria levels may not indicate disease progression. Appreciation of factors that impact albuminuria and changes in the measure isimportant for healthcare providers. Routine surveillance us-ing ACR or PCR is warranted in higher risk people with CKD,as changes in urine ACR are associated with kidney failure.Speci \ufb01cally, in large population studies, a doubling of the ACR within a 2-year duration is associated with an increase inthe risk of progression to kidney failure by 50% \u2013100%. 391,392Albuminuria categories Description and rangeGFR categories (ml/min/1.73 m2) Description and rangeA1 G1 \u226590 G2 60\u201389 G3a 45\u201359 G3b 30\u201344 G4 15\u201329 G5 <15 Kidney failureSeverely decreasedModerately to severely decreasedMildly to moderately decreasedMildly decreasedNormal or highA2 A3 Normal to mildly increasedModerately increasedSeverely increased <30 mg/g <3 mg/mmol Screen 1 Screen 1Treat 1 Treat 1Treat 3 Treat 3 Treat 1 Treat 2Treat 2 Treat 3Treat 3 Treat 3 Treat* 3 Treat 4+Treat* 3 Treat 4+Treat 4+ Treat 4+30\u2013299 mg/g 3\u201329 mg/mmol\u2265300 mg/g \u226530 mg/mmolCKD is classified based on: \u0081 Cause (C) \u0081 GFR (G) \u0081 Albuminuria (A) Low risk (if no other markers of kidney disease, no CKD) Moderately increased riskHigh riskVery high risk Figure 13 | Frequency of monitoring glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR) and albuminuria in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

For this reason, the Work Group has de\ufb01ned a doubling in albuminuria or more as exceeding the expected variability and warranting evaluation if replicated upon repeat testing. Conversely, reductions of the ACR byup to 50% are also consistent with random \ufb02uctuation. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Increases in albuminuria and proteinuria are also associated with increased risk of diseaseprogression in pediatric populations.", "A number of studies inpediatric subjects detailed in Table 18 225,228,393\u2013398highlight the value of measurement of albuminuria/proteinuria. Considerations in older adults. Urine ACR in older adult population may be elevated due to the loss of muscle massleading to lower SCr and lower urinary CrCl. In older adultsor people with frailty, the interpretation of urine ACR shouldtake into consideration age-related changes in muscle massand/or sarcopenia. 2.2 Risk prediction in people with CKD The CKD staging heatmaps re \ufb02ect RRs for each CKD cate- gory compared with persons who do not have CKD at apopulation level; however, a person \u2019s absolute risk for each outcome requires the use of risk prediction equations for thespeci\ufb01c adverse event. Individual-level risk prediction can inform key clinical de- cisions, improve the patient-healthcare provider dialogue, andenable personalized care for persons with CKD. 399The heatmap concept introduced in the KDIGO 2012 CKD guidelineemphasizes the RR of adverse outcomes by levels of eGFR andalbuminuria in populations, and encourages healthcareproviders to classify those people with CKD as high risk forkidney, cardiovascular, and other adverse events based on those 2 parameters. 400The heatmaps also reinforce the importance to all of using both eGFR and ACR for assessing severity and prognosis of CKD and are color-coded to indicate those RRs inpopulations but do not enable individual risk prediction. However, the people within a speci \ufb01c\u201ccell\u201don the grid or within an eGFR/ACR category have a wide range of absoluterisks for each of the adverse outcomes of interest. An indi-vidual person \u2019s risk for each outcome is in \ufb02uenced by their underlying etiology of CKD, demographic characteristics,comorbid conditions, and other factors including lifestyle,SES, nutrition, and intercurrent events. Thus, the RRs shownin the heatmap tables can be crudely interpreted as a multi-plier superimposed upon the aforementioned other charac-teristics. There can be substantial variability and overlap, upto 8000% in the risk of CKD progression or 4000% in the riskof kidney failure, for 2 people in the same heatmap category or CKD stage ( Figure 14 401,402)402; therefore, individual risk prediction using accurate and externally validated risk equations is important in the personalization of care andcan be used to inform absolute risk for individual people. The corollary to individualizing absolute risks versus RRs is appreciating the absolute versus relative bene \ufb01ts of disease- modifying therapies. Although the relative bene \ufb01ts of medi- cations such as SGLT2i may appear similar across subgroups, the actual bene \ufb01t on speci \ufb01c outcomes is highest among people who have the higher absolute risks for that outcome. 403Risk prediction equations can be used to better identify these people and perform better than healthcareTable 18 | Impact of albuminuria/proteinuria on CKD progression in pediatrics Study Impact of albuminuria/proteinuria ESCAPE228A 50% reduction of proteinuria within the \ufb01rst 2 months of treatment initiation more than halved the risk of progression of kidney disease over 5 years. Gluck et al.225In a cohort of over 7 million children, 0.1% had CKD G2 or higher. The relative risk of CKD progression, de \ufb01ned as reaching CKD G5 or", "having a 50% decline in eGFR, was doubled for those who had $1\u00feproteinuria on dipstick without hypertension and was quadrupled for those with proteinuria and hypertension over a median follow-up of 5 years. CKiD393ACR of >300 mg/g ( >30 mg/mmol) was associated with an 84% higher risk of disease progression over a median follow-up of 3 years compared with an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol). PCR of 630 mg/g (71 mg/mmol) was associated with an 87% higher risk of disease progression compared with a PCR of 140 mg/g (16 mg/mmol). 4C study394,395Each log higher value of ACR was associated with a 50% higher risk of kidney failure or a 50% decline in eGFR over a median follow-up of 3 years. A 115% increase in albuminuria was associated with faster disease progression after cessation of RASi in children with advanced CKD. ItalKids396Signi \ufb01cantly slower decline in creatinine clearance in people with baseline PCRs of <200 mg/g ( <23 mg/mmol) and 200 \u2013900 mg/g (23\u2013102 mg/mmol) when compared with those with a PCR of >900 mg/g ( >102 mg/mmol). This translated to higher rates of kidney survival over 5 years in the lower proteinuria groups: 97% and 94% vs. 45%. Indian cohort397CKD progression risk within 2 years was tripled for those with proteinuria >2000 mg/g (226 mg/mmol). Japanese cohort398Risk of CKD progression was 7 times as high for those with proteinuria >2000 mg/g ( >226 mg/mmol) compared with those with lower proteinuria concentrations after adjustment for CKD stage, hypertension, sex, and age.

Importantly, some ofthe developed prediction models have been externallyvalidated in multiple populations, have high discriminationperformance (C-statistics >0.8 or higher), and are easily used via online calculators ( Table 19 9,10,407\u2013411). Recommendation 2.2.1: In people with CKD G3\u2013 G5, we recommend using an externally validated risk equation to estimate the absolute risk of kidneyfailure (1A).This recommendation places a high value on the need and po- tential bene \ufb01ts for individual risk prediction to deliver person- alized care for people with CKD. The recommendation is worded to encourage healthcare providers, patients, researchers, andpolicy makers to go beyond broad categories of RR for popula-tion and to estimate the absolute risk of outcomes for each in-dividual. The recommendation also places a high value onexternally", "validated prediction equations that can be applied indiverse healthcare settings and the need for implementation science in laboratory information systems and EMRs to enable the delivery of risk-based care for people with CKD. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. There is a large body of evidence to support the use of the validated risk equations toestimate the absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysisor transplant in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5.

More recently, anadditional externally validated model using serum cystatinC has also been developed in Germany and externallyvalidated in 3 European cohorts. 409A summary of externally validated models for kidney failure is provided below and in Table 19 .9,10,407\u2013411 We highlight here 3 validated models, The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), the Veterans Affairs model, and the Z6 Score model. All of these use routinely collected data fromlabs or EMRs and have been validated in different pop-ulations, both in North America and internationally tovarying degrees. Detailed review of all existing predictionmodels is beyond the scope of this document. The KFRE was developed and initially validated in 8391 adults from 2 Canadian provinces, and subsequently validated in721,357 individuals from more than 30 countries spanning 4continents. 9,10In this large validation study, cohorts from both general populations and nephrology clinic settings wereincluded. Discrimination was excellent (C-statistic >0.80 in 28/ 30 cohorts), and the use of a calibration factor improvedcalibration for some regions outside of North America; the validation populations now exceed 2 million individuals in more than 60 cohorts from nearly every continent. 407,408The KFRE is consistently highly accurate and has not been improvedby the addition of longitudinal slopes or variability of eGFR andurine ACR, or by adding cardiovascular comorbidities. 407 A further 2 externally validated models from large US health systems (Kaiser Permanente North West and VeteransAffairs) also use routinely collected data and predict kidney failure with high accuracy within a 5-year horizon. 410,414Only 1 externally validated model for kidney failure has been developed using serum cystatin C (Z6 model), and althoughit is highly accurate in 4 European cohorts, it has not beenvalidated in other continents. 409 The Work Group judged that the published externally vali- dated models (delineated in Table 199,10,407\u2013411) all had suf\ufb01cient accuracy to be used in clinical settings. Given the potential bene \ufb01ts and utility of knowing the risk of kidney failure, patients and healthcare providers should beencouraged to use these tools. Assessing risk of progressioncan aid in optimizing healthcare delivery services, facilitatethe earlier identi \ufb01cation of individuals for disease-modifying therapy, help with planning for modality education, andidentify goals of care planning. There are limited butsupportive studies describing the better prediction of outcomes when using risk equations compared with care that is delivered according to isolated eGFR values and clinicaljudgment. Potential harms from the use of predictionequations could result from inappropriate use in the settingsof AKI or AKD or in younger individuals with CKD G1 \u2013G2 who may be at high risk of progression but low risk of kidneyfailure in the next 5 years. In these people, more proximaloutcomes such as 40% decline in GFR or lifetime risk were judged to be more appropriate (i.e., establishing a validated risk equation for the appropriate outcome of interest, derivedfrom the population of interest). As described above,healthcare providers should be cognizant of", "the impact ofbiological and analytical variability in albuminuria and eGFRvalues and the subsequent impact on calculation of predictedrisk of kidney failure. Certainty of the evidence. To assess the certainty of evidence, the ERTexamined 2 existing systematic reviews addressing thequestion of the ability of risk prediction models to predictkidney failure (see Supplementary Table S6 ). 406,415The 2021 review from NICE in the United Kingdom (UK) assessed thecertainty of evidence for a variety of risk-based equations topredict kidney failure and concluded that there was high-quality evidence to state that the chosen risk predictionequations accurately predict kidney failure. 415There was high certainty of the evidence (C-statistics were high, and the CIswere narrow). The Tangri 2013 review did not assess thecertainty of evidence as part of the review (SupplementaryTables S6 \u2013S9 9,85,89,94,96,408,416).406 The Work Group agreed with the NICE assessment and considered evidence from other systematic reviews andrecently published validation studies. The certainty of evi-dence was based on the established and growing evidence base for clinical validation and clinical utility as well as feasibility for validated risk prediction equations that predict kidneyfailure. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that the accurate prediction of kidney failure was of importance topeople with CKD, their families, and healthcare providers,and that most people with CKD would choose to receiveprognostic information about their individual risk of kidney failure as part of routine care. For a global guideline, the Work Group focused on prediction equations that were externallyvalidated, had a low risk of bias, and included variables thatwere routinely available in most healthcare settings. Resource use and costs. Most externally validated risk equations for predicting kidney failure use routinely collecteddata including laboratory variables such as eGFR, albumin-uria, and serum albumin, phosphate, calcium, or hemoglo- bin, or information on demographics and comorbid conditions that can be easily obtained. As such, these modelscan be easily implemented at low cost to health systems. Only1 externally validated model (Z6 Score) used cystatin C, andits usability in global health will depend on the potentialincreased routine availability of cystatin C in laboratoriesworldwide. Considerations for implementation. Given the potential value of risk prediction models for planning and care de-cisions, healthcare providers should consider how to integraterisk prediction models into clinical practice, either in EMRs,laboratory information systems, or using other mechanismschapter 2 www.kidney-international.org S200 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 (mobile apps). These should aid clinical work \ufb02ow and deci- sion-making and even patient understanding. Where possible, laboratories should report the results from a validated riskequation speci \ufb01c to the region automatically for individuals with CKD G3 \u2013G5 when the required variables are available. Simpler equations can be implemented and reported whenminimal data are available and more complex equations,requiring additional variables, can be implemented if therequired data are present. The reporting of risk in the laboratory reports and EMRs should be standardized with appropriate guidance on riskthresholds, when available. Local validation studies can be performed to determine optimal calibration of the speci \ufb01c risk prediction equations before implementation. Imple- mentation of risk equations that are externally", "validated anduse routinely collected data should be prioritized for healthequity and global health considerations. Rationale Risk prediction equations that are externally validated, andlocally calibrated, when possible, can lead to improvement inthe delivery of CKD care. These equations should be used asthey can further personalize care plans for people with CKDand enable discussions about the bene \ufb01ts and harms of dis- ease-modifying therapy. This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group judged that the evidence supporting both the clinical validityand clinical utility of risk prediction equations was suf \ufb01ciently strong to recommend widespread adoption. The Work Groupjudged that most externally validated equations rely onroutinely collected data and could therefore be implementedequally in low-resource settings. The Work Group also judgedthat the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calcu-lating the risk of kidney failure and discussing the risk and related treatment decisions with patients and caregivers. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Work from the CKiD group (2015) provides a risk calculator for disease progression, using age, sex, glomerular versus nonglomerular disease, eGFR, hypertensionand laboratory parameters (calculator available at https://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculatorPedRiskCalc ). 417 Further analyses combining the CKiD data with that from theESCAPE trial (of BP control in CKD progression in children)resulted in a risk calculator that uses diagnosis, eGFR and proteinuria, and can be accessed at www.ckdprognosis. com. 418The 4-value KFRE has been validated in the CKiD cohort with good discrimination.416However, further evaluation of the calibration in the cohort revealed incongruence between predicted and observed outcomes inthose with higher predicted risks of kidney failure (who hadlower observed risks). 419 Considerations regarding sex and gender. There is uncer- tainty around whether sex assigned at birth or gender identityis to be used in risk equations. At present, a holistic approachshould be used that takes into account sex assigned at birth,sex hormone milieu, and gender identity with shared deci-sion-making with the person with CKD. Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% \u20135% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and otherclinical considerations. In most developing and developed countries, there are insuf\ufb01cient nephrology care resources to manage all people with CKD. Using an objective tool to appropriately triagethose most likely to bene \ufb01t from referral may help to manage those nephrology resources in an evidence-informed manner.Because only a small fraction of the CKD population is athigh risk for progression to kidney failure, those people withlower risks of progression to kidney failure may be effectively managed in primary care settings with guideline-based treatments to delay CKD progression (Figure 15 ). Referral criteria for nephrology services that include a risk thresholdof 3% \u20135% over 5 years have been examined retrospectively and have also been implemented prospectively in severalhealthcare settings. 420,421 In settings within Canada and the UK, retrospective studies have found that the use of these risk thresholds has avoided harms from nonreferral or delayed referral of those progressing to kidney failure.412In addition, prospective evaluation has demonstrated a reduction in nephrology eGFR-based criteria Risk-based", "criteriaTransition from primary care to nephrology careTransition from nephrology care to interprofessional careAccess and transplant planning eGFR 90 60 30 20 \u226410Kidney failure KF risk \u22653%\u20135% 5 yearsKF risk \u226510% 2 yearsKF risk \u226540% 2 yearseGFR 30\u201360 eGFR <30 eGFR <20 Figure 15 | Transition from an estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR)-based to a risk-based approach to chronic kidney disease care. KF, kidney failure.www.kidney-international.org chapter 2 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S201 referral wait times, particularly for high-risk individuals. In other clinical settings with relatively scarce access tonephrology care, these thresholds should be adjusted toensure that wait times are acceptable for local standards. 421 Discussion of risk should also consider the individualperson, their comorbidities, and their risk of death fromother causes. Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinicalconsiderations. People with CKD G4 \u2013G5 are more likely to develop con- current complications of CKD including anemia, hyper-kalemia, bone mineral disorders, and/or metabolic acidosisand protein-energy wasting. In addition, they remain at highrisk for adverse events including AKI, emergency departmentvisits, and hospitalizations. As such, in many countries andhealthcare settings, these people may be enrolled in inter-disciplinary care clinics or receive care management resources to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs, and to avoid un- planned dialysis initiation. A risk threshold risk of >10% over 2 years has been studied and implemented in some jurisdictions in Canada asthe key eligibility criteria for access to interdisciplinary carethat includes a nurse, pharmacist, renal dietitian or accreditednutrition provider, and other allied health support. Thispractice point is based on results from these studies, which demonstrate acceptance and preference of a risk-based criteria by patients and providers. 422Given the costs associated with delivery of care management resources andinterdisciplinary models, risk-based thresholds offer a usefulguide to the selection of the ideal target patient populationto derive most bene \ufb01t from the highly specialized team. It is important to note that people with CKD at earlier stagesor those at lower risk of progression may bene \ufb01t from an individual allied health resource (e.g., pharmacist ordietitian); however, risk-based thresholds provide a guide toidentify people with CKD who bene \ufb01t most from an entire multidisciplinary team. Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of>40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria andother clinical considerations. The appropriate timing for modality education, timing of vascular access planning, or referral for transplantation in aperson with low or declining GFR can be dif \ufb01cult to predict. Vascular access planning in all adults with CKD G4 wouldlead to the unnecessary placement of \ufb01stulae, whereas waiting until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2may lead to inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysisinitiation. Studies have described the potential utility of risk-based thresholds in planning for dialysis access speci \ufb01callyand found acceptable", "speci \ufb01city and positive predictive values for the risk-based threshold criteria as compared with eGFRalone. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular ac-cess guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based threshold >50% or eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2for initiation of vascular access planning, while acknowledging that access to surgeons and primary failure to maturationrates may vary by patient and by center. 423 Based on current evidence, a threshold of >40% risk or an eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2is acceptable to use for initiating vascular access referral. Lower risk thresholds, suchas>20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate modality education, and may be appropriate for presurgicalvascular access planning or referral for transplantation incenters with longer wait times. Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5, may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1 \u2013G2. The Work Group recognizes that the progression of CKD can occur at all severities, and that in earlier stages of disease(G1\u2013G3), large declines in eGFR can occur in 2- to 5-year time frames without reaching kidney failure (Figure 16 424). Risk prediction models developed in populations with later stages of CKD are not accurate in CKD G1 \u2013G2, whereas alternative, accurate, externally validated risk predictionequations have been developed for predicting 40% decline ineGFR or kidney failure at all stages of CKD. For this Patient profile: 50-year-old male with diabetes, eGFR 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2, urine ACR 1 g/g Kidney failure risk: 0.07% over 2 years, 0.23% over 5 years CKD progression risk: 10.4% over 3 years 024681012 Risk (%) 2 years 3 yearsKidney failure* 0.07%CKD progression* 10.4% Figure 16 | Comparison of risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression (5-year probability of estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) versus kidney failure in adults with CKD G1 \u2013G2 calculated from the risk equation available at https://www.ckdpc.org/risk-models.html .*Kidney failure risk calculated from Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).

People with CKD identi \ufb01ed as intermediate risk (e.g.,>1% per year) with these tools may bene \ufb01t from the earlier initiation of therapy and closer follow-up, and those identi \ufb01ed as high risk (e.g., >5% per year) may have the largest bene \ufb01t from multidrug therapy to slow progression. Practice Point 2.2.5: Use disease-speci \ufb01c, externally vali-", "dated prediction equations in people with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Risk prediction models for speci \ufb01c etiologies of CKD have also been developed, are externally validated, and used inhealthcare settings to guide clinical care. For autosomal domi-nant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 2 equations can beuseful in determining the longer-term risk of kidney failure andmay guide therapy with tolvaptan\u2014 the Mayo Clinic Classi \ufb01- cation tool and the Predicting Renal Outcome in PolycysticKidney Disease (PROPKD) score, 426,427which incorporates genetic data. Of these, the Mayo Clinic Classi \ufb01cation tool has been shown to be accurate in external validation. In people with IgAN, 2 externally validated prediction tools (clinical or clinical \u00fehistology) have been developed using large international cohort studies. Models that includedthe mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hyper- cellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular at- rophy/interstitial \ufb01brosis (T) (MEST) histological score were more accurate (C-statistic: 0.81 \u20130.82 vs. 0.78) and showed improved reclassi \ufb01cation in development and external vali- dation datasets. 428,429Given the availability of accurate externally validated models, these should be preferentiallyused over more general CKD models in people with anestablished diagnosis of IgAN or ADPKD. It is important to note that the clinical presentation of IgAN can include rapidly progressive disease, and people with rapidlyprogressive GN may not have been well represented in thecohorts used to develop existing prediction tools.2.3 Prediction of cardiovascular risk in people with CKD Practice Point 2.3.1: For cardiovascular risk prediction to guide preventive therapies in people with CKD, use externallyvalidated models that are either developed within CKDpopulations or that incorporate eGFR and albuminuria. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportion- ately affect people with CKD, and risk prediction toolsdeveloped in the general (non-CKD) population may un- derestimate the risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) or heart failure in CKD populations. Absolute risk is used todetermine eligibility for disease-modifying pharmacologicaltherapy in CVD guidelines, and underestimation of risk maylead to suboptimal treatment of people with CKD, perpetu-ating biases (\u201c renalism \u201d) that have existed for more than 2 decades. New models that have been developed speci \ufb01cally in adults with CKD (QRISK3 430) and severe CKD (ckdpc.org ),6 and modi \ufb01cations to existing CVD models (pooled cohort equations [PCE]/Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation[SCORE] 431) that include eGFR and albuminuria should be used to predict cardiovascular events in individuals withCKD. 390\u2013393,427,428,430,431,432In the case of the PCE, the CKD patch signi \ufb01cantly improves the calibration of ASCVD risk, and the eGFR patch improves the prediction of CVDmortality using SCORE. Recently, the American Heart Association Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT /C212 , pending) equations were developed in over 6 million US adults aged 30 \u201379 years without known CVD with outcomes of incident ASCVD and HF (combined and separately).433,434These equations included eGFR in the primary model and included ACR in an add-on model, sothey may be particularly appropriate for people with CKD. Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validatedmodels that predict all-cause mortality speci \ufb01cally devel- oped", "in the CKD population. People with CKD are at high risk of all-cause mortality, and the competing risk of death can affect clinical decision-making, particularly for older adults with CKD G4, who maysimultaneously be at high risk of kidney failure requiringdialysis. All-cause mortality can be challenging to predict dueto the multiple biological pathways and differences inTable 20 | Externally validated risk models for predicting a 40% decline in GFR Variables Population/eventsTime horizon (yr)Discrimination and calibration CKD-PC42416 variables including demography, CVD risk factors, clinical and laboratory variable1.6 million adults with or at risk for CKD5 0.74\u20130.77 Klinrisk820 laboratory variables derived from CBC, chemistry panel, and urine177,196 adults with CKD G1 \u2013G4 or at risk for CKD1\u20135 0.84 \u20130.88 KidneyIntelx4253 proprietary biomarkers, 5 additional clinical variables including albuminuria, BP1146 adults with CKD G1 \u2013G3 and diabetes5 0.77 BP, blood pressure; CBC, complete blood count; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKD-PC, Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate.www.kidney-international.org chapter 2 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S203 personal preferences and goals of care that are not captured by risk prediction models. Models developed by the CKD-PCfor multiple outcomes in CKD G4 \u00fepredict the risk of death, nonfatal CVD event, or kidney failure in adults at 2 and 4 years and were developed using multinational data. 6,434 A 5-year mortality model was also developed in the Car- diovascular Health Study in older adults from the United States, where the majority of people had CKD G3.434Both models have modest discrimination (C-statisticsapproximately 0.70). These may be more appropriate toidentify high-risk groups, where earlier discussions aboutconservative care pathways or alternative goals of care mayhave been helpful. These models should not be used to determine the futility of initiating KRT.

Risk factors associated with CKD progression, CVD, and other CKD complications are highly interrelated, 435and hence so is their management. We use the term \u201cCKD treatment and risk modi \ufb01cation \u201dto encompass the aim of CKD treatment, which is to impart meaningful bene \ufb01cial effects on \u201cCKD manifestations\u201d and on \u201cCKD outcomes \u201d (Figure 17 ). CKD manifestations include symptoms and clinical/laboratory abnormalities associated with CKD, which confer health implications. These include increasedBP, anemia, dyslipidemia, CKD-mineral and bone disorder(CKD-MBD), potassium disorders, severe acidosis,decreased fertility, and increased risk of complications ofpregnancy. CKD outcomes refer to progression to kidneyfailure and CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. Theseare wide ranging and include several CVDs, hospitalization, infections, and gout. Reducing the risk of CKD progression by targeting its underlying pathophysiology may havebene\ufb01cial effects on a range of CKD manifestations and CKD-associated outcomes, although some complicationsmay need speci \ufb01c targeted interventions. Healthcare systems should aim to provide safe and proven cost-effectivetherapies that achieve", "CKD treatment and risk modi \ufb01cation and to minimize limitations to access for people with CKDas their disease can substantially impact on QoL andhealthcare system resources. A key goal for healthcareproviders should be to identify people at risk and to startsuch treatments early in the course of CKD to maximizepotential bene \ufb01ts. This chapter provides evidence-based guidelines to sup- port holistic management of the risks associated with CKD (Figure 18 ). Previously published KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for the management of BP, diabetes, lipids, anemia, and CKD-MBD in CKD are available and supportour statements. 19\u201321,23,436This chapter also describes certain laboratory abnormalities including bicarbonate, potassium,and uric acid, together with a summary of the observedranges associated with different stages of CKD 3.2 Lifestyle factors Practice Point 3.2.1: Encourage people with CKD to under-take physical activity compatible with cardiovascular health, tolerance, and level of frailty; achieve an optimal body mass index (BMI); and not to use tobacco products. Referral toproviders and programs (e.g., psychologists, renal dietitiansor accredited nutrition providers, pharmacists, physical andoccupational therapy, and smoking cessation programs)should be offered where indicated and available.

We also appreciate that different healthcare systems and regions will have variable access to suchspecialized services or teams, and thus availability may be anissue. 3.2.1 Avoiding use of tobacco products The Work Group concurs with the previous KDIGO recom-mendations to advise people with diabetes and CKD who uset o b a c c ot oq u i tu s i n gt o b a c c op r o d u c t s 23and extends that advice to all people with CKD who use tobacco products to reduce therisk of associated premature mortality from CVD, as well as risk of respiratory diseases and cancer. 437Intensive nurse-led programs appear effective at supporting smoking abstinence and can be combined with pharmacological intervention (e.g.,nicotine replacement therapy of nicotine-receptor partialagonists) to improve smoking abstinence over 16 weeks. 438See the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease21 and KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease23for", "full details.

We draw attention to thefollowing statements: Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that peo- ple with CKD be advised to undertake moderate- intensity physical activity for a cumulative durationof at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D). Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical ac- tivity should consider age, ethnic background, presence ofother comorbidities, and access to resources. Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior. Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensityof physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and thetype of exercises (aerobic vs.", "resistance, or both). Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/ encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight. BMI relates to levels of adiposity on a population scale (though imperfectly), and a BMI of over 25 kg/m 2in adults (i.e., overweight or obese) is associated with an inc reased risk of multiple chronic diseases including development of CKD.439,440Such adiposity- CKD associations appear to be causal.441,442BMI can overestimate risk in people with high muscle mass,443and risk for a given BMI may vary by ethnicity (with Asians being athigher risk of metabolic disorders at lower BMIs than Europeans). 443,444Nevertheless, it is important to provide people with CKD advice about their weight using BMI in conjunction with other information, including ethnicity, diet, comorbidity,physical activity levels, risk of falls, and laboratory values. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD toundertake physical activity aiming for World Health Or-ganization (WHO) \u2013advised levels (i.e., \u202160 minutes daily) and to achieve a healthy weight. The WHO recommends 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for children 5 \u201317 years old, including aer- obic activities as well as activities that strengthen muscle andbone. 445Limits on sedentary time, particularly screen time, are also recommended. For children 1 \u20135y e a r so fa g e ,1 8 0m i n u t e s per day of physical activity is recommended; young children int h i sa g eg r o u ps h o u l dn o tb er e s t r a i n e d( i . e . ,i nas t r o l l e ro rcarrier) for >60 minutes at a time. Only 13.4% of 224 participants of the CKiD study aged $12 years (median: 15 years) met these WHO targets, 240,257,303,305,446compared with 25% of general population children of comparable age.447Less than 2% of CKiD participants met screen timerecommendations ( <2 hours per day on school days) compared with 27% of the general population. Physical activityhas numerous bene \ufb01ts for cardiovascular, mental, and social health. Given that children with CKD are at higher risk forproblems in all these areas, physical activity may be even moreimportant in the CKD population. 3.3 Diet Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and alower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about di-etary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potas-sium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions. Plant-based diets use proportionately more plant-based food choices, and animal-based food is consumed in moderation. Diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension(DASH) are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fatdairy foods. A Mediterranean diet pattern is built aroundvegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, whole grains, and seafoodbut also includes moderate amounts of dairy, meat, and eggs. By de \ufb01nition, vegan and vegetarian diets are plant-based. A whole-food,", "plant-based diet low in animal-based and ultra- processed foods may be helpful to slow the progression of CKDand delay need for dialysis via reduction of cardiometabolic riskfactors such as hypertension, CVD, diabetes, and obesity. 448,449 Ultraprocessed foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fastfoods, frozen meals, chips, candy, and pastries are high insalt, sugar, and fat, and low in nutritional value, and they promote in \ufb02ammation, which may contribute to worsening kidney function. A plant-based diet is rich in anti- in\ufb02ammatory nutrients, \ufb01ber, and phytochemicals, and has been shown to reduce proteinuria and decrease metabolicacidosis. 448,449The probiotic nature of plant-based foods may also support the microbiome and reduce in \ufb02ammation and intestinal production of uremic toxins.450A recent systematic review evaluated the association of dietary patterns and kidney-related outcomes.451,452Dietary patterns that include more plant-based unprocessed protein have been demonstrated, in cohort studies and small RCTs, to slow thetrajectory of eGFR decline, reduce the risk of kidney failure,reduce risk of mortality, and improve scores in some QoLdomains (e.g., DASH and Mediterranean diet).www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S207 3.3.1 Protein intake Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with CKD G3\u2013 G5(2C). Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression. Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, considerprescribing, under close supervision, a very low \u2013protein diet (0.3 \u20130.4 g/kg body weight/d) supplemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kgbody weight/d). Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low \u2013 protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD. This recommendation places a higher value on slowing the rate of GFR decline without the challenges associated with adherence to lower-protein diets, potential adverse effects, andthe contraindications in people with sarcopenia, cachexia, orundernutrition. The Work Group judged that many well-informed people with CKD G3 \u2013G5 would choose to implement this recommendation. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. The Work Group considered that maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight perday in adults in the absence of indications for a higher orlower protein intake was congruent with a person \u2019s culture and QoL. Considerations for protein restriction in the contextof individual preferences, true impact on CKD progressionbased on etiology, and other factors need to be consideredand weighed against any potential adverse impacts, such asmalnutrition. In many societies, most adults and older adults consume more protein than recommended, with average protein intakesof 1.2 g/kg/d. 453,454There is general agreement that, in the absence of intercurrent disease, the protein requirements forpeople with CKD are not different from those of healthysubjects. 455The Work Group thus suggests maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d, a target consistentwith the WHO Recommended Dietary Allowances for thegeneral population. 456,457Figure 1923shows some examplesof the amount of protein in grams that would berecommended based on body weight. Clinicians shouldadvise", "people with CKD not to confuse grams of protein perday with the weight of food in grams (i.e., 100 g of meat contains only approximately 25 g of protein; Figure 20 23). Unlike carbohydrates and fats, excess dietary proteins cannot be stored in the body and are catabolized, leading to accumulation of protein waste products such as urea andother uremic toxins. As CKD progresses, these byproductsaccumulate and affect organ function. High-protein intakealso contributes to increased intraglomerular pressure andglomerular hyper \ufb01ltration, which, in turn, may lead to glo- merulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. 458,459 Progressive decline in kidney function is also associatedwith a spontaneous loss of appetite potentially leading toinadequate protein and energy intake. 460The Work Group therefore encourages maintaining protein intake in adultswith CKD within the recommended range around 0.8 g/kgbody weight/d, and particularly avoiding excess proteinintakes ( >1.3 g/kg of body weight/d), which may be harmful for the kidney. 455There is observational evidence suggesting that excess protein intake may accelerate kidneyfunctional decline. 461\u2013463 The protein type, not only the quantity, may also be relevant. Table 21 brie\ufb02y summarizes the impact of plant- based diets in people with CKD.464\u2013470In another cohort study of older subjects (N \u00bc291, mean age 76 years) with eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, there was no signi \ufb01cant association between vegetable protein intake and change ineGFR. 460Observational studies452,464,465and an RCT466 have associated a higher plant-based protein relative toanimal-based protein consumption or adherence to plant-based protein dominant diets with slower eGFR declineover time and lower risk of death; no study so far hasassessed the measures of patient preferences. 471It is unclear whether the associations are attributed to plant-based protein intake per se or to other nutrients or lifestyle habits that accompany the plant-based protein intervention; however, there is biological plausibility. A crossover study of10 healthy individuals fed for 3 weeks evaluated the effectof a plant-based protein diet versus an animal-based proteindiet on kidney function parameters. Both diets provided thesame amount of total protein per day. Compared withanimal-based protein, a plant-based protein diet reduced renal plasma \ufb02ow, increased renal vascular resistance, and lowered the fractional clearance of albumin. 472,473 Body weight (kg) Grams of protein per day (wt \u00d7 0.8 g/kg)35 2840325040554460486552705675608064856890729576100 80 Figure 19 | Protein guideline for adults with chronic kidney disease not treated with dialysis. wt, body weight in kg.

They may also reduce uremic complications andsymptoms, such as metabolic acidosis and phosphate load. 476 The Work Group considers that the evidence does not sup- port a recommendation to follow low-protein diets alone (i.e.,0.4\u20130.6 g/kg of body weight/d) as a strategy to slow the pro- gression of CKD. In a meta-analysis of people with CKD withoutdiabetes, 477a low-protein diet compared with a normal-protein diet in participants with CKD G3a and G3b (9 studies) or CKDG4 (1 study) found little or no difference in mortality or eGFRdecline and little or no difference in the number of participants who reached kidney failure (6 studies, 1814 participants: RR, 1.05; 95% CI: 0.73 \u20131.53). Similar null associations were observed in a meta-analysis of 8 studiesinvolving people with diabetes and CKD. 478 However, there is some evidence that very low \u2013protein diets (i.e., 0.3 \u20130.4 g/kg of body weight/d) under strict supervision can favorably impact kidney outcomes. A meta-analysis ofstudies including people with CKD G4 \u2013G5 without diabetes reported that very low \u2013protein diets compared with low-pro- tein diet or normal-protein diet may reduce the number ofpeople who reach kidney failure (10 studies, 1010 participants:RR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49 \u20130.85). 477Data on adverse effects, such as weight loss and malnutrition, and on QoL were limited.There is limited evidence on the use of very low \u2013protein diets in people with CKD and diabetes. 23 Animal proteins Meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs: 28 g (1 oz) = 6\u20138 g protein 1 egg = 6\u20138 g protein Dairy, milk, yogurt, cheese: 250 ml (8 oz) = 8\u201310 g protein 28 g (1 oz) cheese = 6\u20138 g proteinPlant proteins Legumes, dried beans, nuts, seeds: 100 g (0.5 cup) cooked = 7\u201310 g protein Whole grains, cereals: 100 g (0.5 cup) cooked = 3\u20136 g protein Starchy vegetables, breads: 2\u20134 g protein Figure 20 | Average protein content of foods in grams.

A strategy to counteract this is the addition of supplements of essential amino acids or precursors of essential amino acids (i.e., ketoacid analogs). By lacking the amino group, ketoacid analogs serve as substrates for protein synthesis without the productionof toxic nitrogenous waste products. Limitations of ketoacidanalogs are, however, high pill burden and high cost. Fifteenmonths of strict adherence to vegetarian very low \u2013protein diets of 0.3 g/kg body weight/d supplemented with 0.125 g/kg bodyweight/d of ketoacids in people with an average eGFR of 18 ml/min per 1.73 m 2at baseline slowed the decline in eGFR, increased bicarbonate levels, and reduced the need for KRTcompared with a control group that ate a mixed-protein diet of0.6 g/kg body weight/d. 479A recent pragmatic trial was not able to reproduce this \ufb01nding,480potentially attributed by the authors to challenges in patient compliance with the treatment. There is concern that low-protein and very low \u2013protein diets may result in malnutrition. However, in the meta-analysis byHahn et al., 47712 studies reported no evidence of malnutrition in their study participants, whereas 3 studies reported smallnumbers of participants in each arm with worseningnutritional status. The estimated average requirement forprotein intake in adults is approximately 0.5 \u20130.6 g/kg body weight/d, which corresponds to the amount of proteinrequired to avoid negative nitrogen balance. 456Thus under correct supervision, these diets may not lead to malnutrition.Malnutrition may arise if the reduction in protein is followed by a reduction in energy intake. This may be preventable by adequate patient education on food choices and closesupervision by renal dietitians or accredited nutritionspecialists. A patient-centered approach involves a sharedunderstanding of treatment goals, effective communication toalleviate anxieties around food or food misconceptions,individualized advice that matches cultural values andpreferences, and assistance with implementation of dietetic advice in the face of a large symptom burden. Some of the trials on low-protein", "diets were conducted before treatment with RASi was introduced, and all of them before the SGLT2i era. Because the mechanism of action ofthese medications and that of low-protein and very low \u2013 protein diets are complementary, it has been postulated thatthese strategies may synergize and maximize their combinedeffect on delaying CKD progression. 475,481,482Studies are needed to demonstrate this hypothesis. Low- or very low \u2013protein diets are not indicated in people who are metabolically unstable or during periods of metabolicinstability. This includes conditions that may exacerbate therisk of malnutrition in the context of low-protein intake, suchas sarcopenia, cachexia, active in \ufb02ammatory or infectious diseases, periods of hospitalization or the early postoperativeperiod, poorly controlled diabetes, consumptive diseases such as cancer, treatment of antibiotic or immunosuppressive medications, and signi \ufb01cant short-term loss of body weight. Certainty of evidence. The certainty of evidence was moder- ate that there was little to no difference in the critical outcome ofall-cause death and kidney failure prevention when comparingvery low \u2013protein to low- or normal-protein diets, and moderate that there was some bene \ufb01t to the critical outcome of kidney failure for the comparison of very low \u2013protein diets with low- or normal-protein diets as demonstrated by the wide CIs for theseoutcomes including potential for important bene \ufb01ts and harms. In addition, there was important and unexplained heterogeneitypresent. It is uncertain whether low- or very low \u2013protein diets impact a change in GFR. The certainty of evidence was very low when comparing low- protein to normal-protein diets for a change in GFR and low whencomparing very low \u2013protein to low- or normal-protein diets. This is because the CIs included potential for important bene \ufb01ts and harms. There was important and unexplained heterogeneitypresent; the outcome was reported as a surrogate outcome; andthere was unclear allocation concealment in 4 studies. The overall certainty of evidence for the remaining out- comes was very low because of increased risk of bias andsmall studies with wide CIs. In addition, many studies wereunclear about allocation concealment/random sequence generation, and had signi \ufb01cant, unexplained heterogeneity, wide CIs for important bene \ufb01ts and harms, and use of sur- rogate outcomes. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that some clinically suitable people would choose to implement a diet with protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d unless there areconditions that contraindicate such as sarcopenia, cachexia,or undernutrition. In addition, the Work Group judged that protein restriction would be implemented by many people as a way of managing their kidney disease. It will also have animpact on overall QoL with the adoption of a more plant-based diet; however, there may be challenges with imple-menting and adhering to these changes. Resource use and costs. The risks, bene \ufb01ts, resource use, and costs of dietary protein interventions should be consid-ered when treating people with CKD. The Work Group considered that plant-based proteins could have a cost-bene \ufb01t effect compared with animal-based protein, but evidence in this topic remains limited. Considerations for implementation. Protein restriction without support and advice from renal dietitians", "or otheraccredited nutrition providers may result in low dietary di-versity and limited food choices, adversely impacting QoLand altering fundamental components of a person \u2019s culture and daily life. The use of culturally appropriate foods that aremore familiar to people, nutritional status, goals of care, QoL,and patient preferences should be considered in the imple-mentation of these recommendations and practice points. Rationale The Work Group suggests dietary protein interventions basedon consideration of the possible bene \ufb01ts of plant-based foods, kidney protection, and avoidance of adverse effect of unsu-pervised protein restriction. People with CKD not on dialysiswith or without diabetes may opt for some degree of dietaryprotein moderation, especially as control of dietary intakechapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S210 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 empowers people with CKD and supports self-care manage- ment. People put a large value on diet, cultural preferences,and QoL; however, adherence to a low-protein diet remainschallenging, may impact social and psychological well-being, and given that most of the trials for protein restriction were conducted before RASi and SGLT2i were implemented, maynot be worth the sacri \ufb01ce/change in lifestyle. The impact of protein restriction and the use of non \u2013animal-based protein diets should be evaluated in the context of new care para-digms to ascertain the incremental gain of these strategiesrelative to the efforts and costs. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake inchildren with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The target protein and energy intake in children with CKD G2\u2013G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth. Children with CKD likely have similar resting energy expenditure to healthy children and should have total energyrequirements in the normal range. 483As in adults, protein restriction was considered for children with CKD in the past.Two RCTs have compared low-protein versus normal-protein diets in children with CKD. 484,485One found poorer growth for those on a low-protein diet, and the other found no difference in eGFR between the groups. A 2007 Cochranemeta-analysis concluded that there was uncertainty over thepossible harm of strict low-protein diets on growth in younginfants. 486The 2009 KDOQI guidelines and the 2020 Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce suggest maintaining an intake ofdietary protein at 100% \u2013140% of the dietary reference intake (DRI) or the SDI for ideal body weight in children with CKDG3 and at 100% \u2013120% of the DRI/SDI in children with CKD G4\u2013G5. 487,488 Older adults. Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlyingconditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higherprotein and calorie dietary targets. In older adults with CKD, nutritional management should consider potential challenges stemming from simultaneousand potentially con \ufb02icting risks of CKD progression and malnutrition/protein-energy wasting. In older adults, proteintargets should be set after careful individual assessment to identify the most urgent clinical challenge. Geriatric guidelines recommend protein intakes of 1.0 \u20131.2 g/ kg body weight/d to prevent age-related malnutrition and pre- vent sarcopenia. 489Such protein intakes may be appropriate in some people with stable or slowly progressing CKD, whoseclinical", "picture is dominated by old age and related challengesto their nutritional and functional status. On the other hand,protein restriction may be appropriate in older adults whose primary clinical challenge is CKD with signi \ufb01cant progression, provided they are metabolically stable. 490The course of action should consider patient preferences and when necessary, involve family members and caregivers.3.3.2 Sodium intake The Work Group concurs with the following recommenda-tion from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease 23and the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for theManagement of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease . 21 Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD ( 2C). Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wastingnephropathy. Global average sodium intake is estimated to be 4310 mg/ d (10.78 g of salt per day), which far exceeds the physiologicalrequirement and is more than double the WHO recommenda- tion of <2 g of sodium (equivalent to <5 g of salt) per day in adults. 491This perhaps re \ufb02ects the pervasive use of sodium in many commercial food products, which makes achieving WHO targets challenging to meet for many people. There arelarge-scale RCTs quantifying the bene \ufb01ts of restricted salt intake (e.g., using 75% sodium and 25% potassium chloridesalt substitutes) to lower BP and reduce the risk ofcardiovascular events in the general population. 492In RCTs with up to 36 weeks of follow-up, reduction in dietary sodiumhas also been shown to lower BP and levels of albuminuria inpeople with CKD. 492\u2013494Although presumed to reduce the risk of CKD progression and CVD, longer term trials have notbeen conducted to con \ufb01rm these effects translate into reduced r i s ko fc l i n i c a lo u t c o m e si nC K D . 493Given the effects of sodium restriction on BP , it is reasonable to recommendsodium restriction to people with CKD in combination with pharmacological strategies to minimize the risk of kidney and CVDs. People with CKD may have salt-wasting kidney disease,malnutrition, or be exposed to extremely hot climaticconditions. In such scenarios, this recommendation may notapply. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based RecommendedDaily Intake when counseling about sodium intake forchildren with CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height. The WHO recommends that the maximum intake of <2g / d sodium ( <5 g/d salt) in adults should be adjusted downward based on the energy requirements of children relative to those of adults ( Table 22 495). Children born with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) are at increased risk for CKD in later life and may also be at higher risk for hypertension and increased saltsensitivity. Salt sensitivity is a physiological trait by which BP in some people exhibits changes parallel to changes in salt intake. Children", "born with low birth weight may have a 37%increased salt sensitivity (de \ufb01n e da sa ni n c r e a s ei nm e a nB Pwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S211 $3 mm Hg over 24 hours while on a high salt diet, when compared with a controlled salt diet). That sensitivity may increase further in those who are small for gestational age.496 Children with CKD often have underlying tubular condi- tions that predispose them to numerous electrolyte losses,including sodium. For these children, a supplemented ratherthan restricted sodium intake will be required. For non \u2013salt- wasting children, salt intake should be limited to the age-based Recommended Daily Intake. 3.4 Blood pressure control The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure inChronic Kidney Disease , which encourages individualized BP targets and use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, andother comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and toleranceto treatments. 21We highlight the following guidance: Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of \ufb01ce BP measurement (2B). Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and frac- tures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic posturalhypotension. RCTs have not demonstrated that intensive BP-lowering results in meaningful reductions in the risk of kidney failure,but the RCT evidence supporting important cardiovascularbene\ufb01ts should encourage such a strategy. By aiming for an SBP <120 mm Hg, more adults with CKD will achieve an SBP <130 mm Hg, even if they do not meet the <120 mm Hg t a r g e t .O b s e r v a t i o n a l l y ,o na v e r a g e ,e a c h2 0m mH gh i g h e rt h a nusual SBP and 10 mm Hg higher diastolic BP is associated withan approximate doubling of cardiovascular risk, with no lowerlimit down to at least 115/75 mm Hg. 497Data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) support the SBPtarget of <120 mm Hg (when measured using a standardized of\ufb01ce BP measurement) to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults aged >75 years, or aged >50 years with 1 or more of the following risk factors: clinical or subclinical CVD (otherthan stroke), eGFR 20 \u201360 ml/min per 1.73 m 2,o r$ 15% 10- year cardiovascular risk.498Compared with a target of 140 mm Hg, this approach reduces the risk of major adversecardiovascular events (MACE) by one-quarter (hazard ratio[ H R ] :0 . 7 5 ;9 5 %C I :0 . 6 4 \u20130.89), and that relative bene \ufb01tw a s similar in people with and without CKD. The SPRINT trialexcluded people with diabetes, but cardiovascular bene \ufb01ts of intensive BP lowering on risk of stroke and heart failure areclearly apparent in people with diabetes", "in individual patientlevel data meta-analysis of intensive versus standard BP-lowering trials. 499 Standardized BP monitoring can be challenging to offer in a clinic setting due to the time required500;h o w e v e r ,i ti s considered potentially hazardous to apply the recommendedSBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a nonstandardized manner. 500A practical solution to ensure the identi \ufb01cation of high BP is by using home-based monitoring (or telemonitoring). Trials have shown that 2 morning andevening BP measurements taken during the \ufb01rst week of every month can be used to titrate antihypertensive medication andreduce BP more than \u201cusual care \u201dapproaches. 501 People who are frail, have limited life expectancy, or have a history of falls and fractures may have increased risk of addi- tional events if BP targets of <120 are achieved. Postural hypotension in these people is associated with adverse out- comes, and thus weighing the bene \ufb01ts of some attenuation of eGFR decline versus the life-changing impact of falls, fractures,and other events should be considered in choosing speci \ufb01c targets. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Managementof Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease , and we high- light the following guidance 21: Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to \u00a350th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C). Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3\u2013 6 months with standardized auscultatory of \ufb01ce BP in children with CKD. Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatoryof\ufb01ce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting, of 50th \u201375th percentile for age, sex, and height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptomsof hypotension. These statements with respect to children are generally worded to maintain consistency with the KDIGO 2021Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of BloodPressure in Chronic Kidney Disease, 21where the full rationale and evidence behind the statements are available. However, the suggestion to target auscultatory of \ufb01ce SBP at the 50th \u2013 75th percentile when ABPM is not available departs fromTable 22 | Age-based sodium intake recommendations495 Age Recommended adequate sodium intake (g/d) 0\u20136 mo 0.110 7\u201312 mo 0.370 1\u20133 yr 0.370 4\u20138 yr 1.0 9\u201313 yr 1.2 14\u201370 yr 1.5chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S212 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 the BP guideline (the previous guideline suggested a target <90th percentile). Although of \ufb01ce BP may be higher than BP measured by ABPM, this is not universally the case.Given the evidence that intensive BP control may slow CKD progression together with the very low risk of adverse effects of intensive BP lowering in children, 228we consider that more intensive BP lowering targeting around the 50thpercentile is reasonable. However, a target even lower thanthe 50th percentile has not been shown to offer additionalbene\ufb01ts. Recent trial data", "found that using a target of of \ufb01ce auscultatory SBP at 50th to 75th percentile versus intensivecontrol to below the 40th percentile did not result in signi\ufb01cant differences in left ventricular mass index. 229 3.5 Glycemic control Please refer to the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease for speci\ufb01c recommendations, practice points, and research recommendations. 3.6 Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors The Work Group highlights recommendations from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Managementof Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease and selected practice points for treatment with RASi from the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of BloodPressure in Chronic Kidney Disease 21and the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management inChronic Kidney Disease . 23The Work Group considers several recommendations to apply even in the absence ofhigh BP and has adapted the recommendations from the BPguideline to remove this requirement. Key recommendationsand practice points are highlighted: Recommendation 3.6.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angio- tensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for peoplewith CKD and severely increased albuminuria (G1 \u2013 G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEior ARB) for people with CKD and moderately increasedalbuminuria (G1 \u2013G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend startingRASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with CKD andmoderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1\u2013G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin in-hibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B).Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve the bene \ufb01ts described because the proven bene \ufb01ts were achieved in trials using these doses. Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2 \u20134 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi,depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the doseor stopping RASi. Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increasein dose. Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or dis- continuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symp-tomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemiadespite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular \ufb01ltra- tion rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for speci \ufb01c indications (e.g., to treat hyper- tension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). The role of RASi (speci \ufb01cally ACEi or ARB) in the manage- ment of BP and people with CKD, diabetes, and/or high BP havebeen speci \ufb01cally considered in recent KDIGO guidelines. 21,23 Although temporarily stopping RASi", "may be a valid treatmentstrategy for emergent hyperkalemia, we advise to ensure the reinitiation of treatments once the adverse event is resolved, so that people are not deprived of a needed medication (PracticePoint 4.3.3). 502\u2013506The Work Group offers the new Practice Point 3.6.6 and a revised algorithm for initiation of RASi(Figure 21 ). 23The algorithm has been updated to suggest a $30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine) should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying othercondition. This represents a threshold above which the eGFR change is greater than would be expected from natural variation. Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intakemay help ensure maximal effects of RASi. Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per1.73 m 2. In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing RASi in CKD G4 \u2013G5 did not result in any kidney or car- diovascular bene \ufb01ts.507Two observational studies have also found that associations suggesting outcomes were worseamong participants who stopped RASi after reaching anwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S213 eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, compared with those who continue.508,509In addition, a recent individual patient level data meta-analysis demonstrated a bene \ufb01t in delaying KRT in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.510 3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease , which stated: \u201cWe recommend treating pa- tients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/ min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A).\u201d23However, in this guideline, we offer a more general 1A recommendation foradults with CKD. We also highlight practice points fromthe KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management inCKD, which are also relevant for people with CKD withoutdiabetes: Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR \u202120 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR fallsbelow 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated.Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2iduring times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or criticalmedical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): /C15eGFR \u202120 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR \u2021200 mg/g ( \u202120 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring andthe reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generallynot an indication to discontinue therapy. Use of SGLT2i in people with T2D is recommended in previous guidelines irrespective of level of albuminuria. This new recom-mendation (3.7.2) places high value on the importance of reducingrisk of kidney failure, cardiovascular mortality,", "and heart failurein people with CKD and high value on the large relative reductionsin risk for kidney disease progression in a series of large, placebo-controlled RCTs. It also places moderate value on the bene \ufb01ts of SGLT2i on risk of AKI, hospitalization for heart failure and myocardial infarction, risk of hospitalization from any cause, and high value on the demonstrable net absolute bene \ufb01ts versus absolute harms in people with CKD (particularly in thoseInitiate ACEi or ARB Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2\u20134 weeks after starting or changing dose) <30% decrease in eGFR Increase dose of ACEi or ARB or continue on maximally tolerated dose\u226530% decrease in eGFRNormokalemia Hyperkalemia \u2022 Review for causes of AKI \u2022 Correct volume depletion \u2022 Reassess concomitant medications (e.g., diuretics, NSAIDs) \u2022 Consider renal artery stenosis\u2022 Review concurrent drugs \u2022 Moderate dietary potassium intake \u2022 Consider: - diuretics - sodium bicarbonate - potassium binders Reduce dose or stop ACEi or ARB if mitigation strategies ineffective Figure 21 | Algorithm for monitoring of potassium and estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) after the initiation of renin- angiotensin system inhibitors.

SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, measures of \ufb02uid over- load, the risk of serious hyperkalemia, and do not increase risk of hypoglycemia. The recommendation is consistent with but ex- pands on Recommendation 1.3.1 from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kid-ney Disease to include people with causes of CKD not related to diabetes . Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. Bene\ufb01 ts.Several large, pla- cebo-controlled RCTs have provided clear demonstrations ofthe ef \ufb01cacy of SGLT2i, which substantially reduce the risk of kidney failure, AKI, and hospitalization for heart failure, andalso moderately reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction in people with and without CKD. These bene\ufb01ts appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of kidney disease, or level of GFR. 511,512The bene \ufb01ts of SGLT2i in people with diabetes and CKD have been fully described inthe KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Kidney Disease. 23 Two large RCTs using 2 different SGLT2i recruited 10,913 participants and focused on CKD populations at risk of progression, reporting bene \ufb01ts in terms of kidney diseaseprogression.403,513Key differences between the 2 trials were the inclusion of a large number of causes of kidney disease not related to diabetes, lower eGFR, and lower levels of ACR in The", "Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagli \ufb02ozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) compared with the Dapagli \ufb02ozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial. In a collaborative metanalysis including those 2 and 11 other trials (13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized par-ticipants) in comparison with placebo, those allocated to anSGLT2i experienced a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in the risk of AKI irrespective of diabetes status ( Figure 22 ). 511 The same meta-analysis showed that, compared with pla- cebo, allocation to an SGLT2i reduced the risk of the com-posite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heartfailure by 23% irrespective of diabetes status (Figure 23 511), although there were limited numbers of cardiovascularevents in people with CKD without diabetes. SGLT2i also afford an approximate 10% RR reduction in MACE, primarily from reduced risk of cardiovascular death andmyocardial infarction with no clear effect on stroke. 511,512 Furthermore, SGLT2i also importantly reduce the risk of hospitalization from any cause,403reduce BP ,403,513,514uricMean baseline eGFR, ml/min per 1.73 m2Events/participants SGLT2 inhibitorPlaceboEvent rate per 1000 patient-years SGLT2 inhibitorPlaceboEvent rate per 1000 patient-years SGLT2 inhibitorPlaceboKidney disease progression RR (95% CI)Events/participants SGLT2 inhibitorPlaceboRR (95% CI)Acute kidney injury 0.75 0.25 0.5 1.00 1.50 Favors SGLT2 inhibitor Favors placebo0.75 0.25 0.5 1.00 1.50 Favors SGLT2 inhibitor Favors placeboDiabetes DECLARE\u2212TIMI 58 CANVAS Program VERTIS CV EMPA\u2212REG OUTCOME DAPA\u2212HF EMPEROR\u2212REDUCED EMPEROR\u2212PRESERVED DELIVER CREDENCE SOLOIST\u2212WHF SCORED DAPA\u2212CKD EMPA\u2212KIDNEY Subtotal: diabetes No diabetes DAPA\u2212HF EMPEROR\u2212REDUCED DELIVER* EMPEROR\u2212PRESERVED DAPA\u2212CKD EMPA\u2212KIDNEY Subtotal: no diabetesTotal: overall8577 76 74 63 61 60 60 56 51 44 44 36 67 68 63 63 62 42 39 56 6556/8582 80/5795 49/5499 51/4645 18/1075 13/927 38/1466 33/1578 153/2202 NA/NA 37/5292 103/1455 108/1525 739/40,041 10/1298 5/936 17/1551 12/1531 39/697 119/1779 202/7792 941/47,833102/8578 81/4347 32/2747 47/2323 24/1064 23/92944/1472 37/1572 230/2199 NA/NA 52/5292 173/1451 175/1515 1020/33,489 15/1307 10/938 17/1557 18/1519 70/701 157/1790 287/7812 1307/41,3011.6 3.6 2.6 4.0 12 13 15 9.527 .. 5.0 35 36 .. 5.0 5.2 5.0 4.5 29 35 .. ..3.0 5.8 3.4 7.6 16 24 18 11 41 .. 7.0 60 59 .. 8.0 10 4.9 6.9 53 47 .. ..0.55 (0.39\u20130.76) 0.61 (0.45\u20130.83) 0.76 (0.49\u20131.19) 0.51 (0.35\u20130.76) 0.73 (0.39\u20131.34) 0.52 (0.26\u20131.03) 0.82 (0.53\u20131.27) 0.87 (0.54\u20131.39) 0.64 (0.52\u20130.79) .. 0.71 (0.46\u20131.08) 0.57 (0.45\u20130.73) 0.55 (0.44\u20130.71) 0.62 (0.56\u20130.68) 0.67 (0.30\u20131.49) 0.50 (0.17\u20131.48) 1.01 (0.51\u20131.97) 0.68 (0.33\u20131.40) 0.51 (0.34\u20130.75) 0.74 (0.59\u20130.95) 0.69 (0.57\u20130.82) 0.63 (0.58\u20130.69) Trend across trials sorted by eGFR: Diabetes P =0.87; No diabetes P=0.86; Heterogeneity by diabetes status: P=0.31125/8574 30/5790 42/5493 45/468731/1073 26/927 60/1466 59/1578 86/2200 25/605 116/5291 48/1455 73/1525 766/40,664 18/1295 20/93630/1551 37/1531 16/697 34/1779 155/7789921/48,453175/8569 28/4344 22/274537/2333 39/1063 33/929 84/1472 52/1572 98/2197 27/611 111/528669/1451 81/1515 856/34,087 30/1305 34/938 47/1558 47/1519 21/701 54/1790 233/7811 1089/41,8983.5 1.6 2.5 2.5 19 21 2017 17 55 16 15 24 .. 9.9 16 8.8 12 11 10 .. ..4.9 2.5 2.7 6.2 24 2728 15 20 59 16 22 27 .. 16 28 14 15 15 16.. ..0.69 (0.55\u20130.87) 0.66 (0.39\u20131.11) 0.95 (0.57\u20131.59) 0.41 (0.27\u20130.63) 0.79 (0.50\u20131.25) 0.77 (0.46\u20131.28) 0.69", "(0.50\u20130.97) 1.13 (0.78\u20131.63) 0.85 (0.64\u20131.13) 0.94 (0.55\u20131.59) 1.04 (0.81\u20131.35) 0.66 (0.46\u20130.96) 0.88 (0.64\u20131.20) 0.79 (0.72\u20130.88) 0.60 (0.34\u20131.08) 0.56 (0.32\u20130.98) 0.64 (0.41\u20131.02) 0.80 (0.52\u20131.23) 0.75 (0.39\u20131.43) 0.63 (0.41\u20130.97) 0.66 (0.54\u20130.81) 0.77 (0.70\u20130.84) Trend across trials sorted by eGFR: Diabetes P=0.02; No diabetes P=0.66; Heterogeneity by diabetes status: P=0.12 Figure 22 | Effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) with kidney disease outcomes by diabetes status.

SGLT2i are well tolerated with high levels of adherence in the RCTs in CKD.403,513,514In the studied populations, any risk of ketoacidosis or lower-limb amputation resulting from SGLT2i use was substantially lower than the potential absolute bene \ufb01ts and generally restricted to people with diabetes. Meta-analysis estimates of absolute bene \ufb01ts and harms for each 1000 people with CKD and T2D treated for 1 year with an SGLT2i were 11fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heartfailure, for approximately 1 episode of ketoacidosis andapproximately 1 lower-limb amputation, respectively (andalso 11 fewer people developing kidney disease progression and 4 fewer people with AKI). The corresponding bene \ufb01ts in people with CKD without diabetes were 15 fewer people with kidney disease progression, 5 fewer with AKI, and 2fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heartfailure per 1000 patient-years of treatment with no excessrisk of ketoacidosis or amputation observed. 511The vast majority of urinary tract infections in people taking SGLT2iare not caused by SGLT2 inhibition, and there is noincreased risk of hypoglycemia. There is an increased risk ofmycotic genital infections (in men and women), but theseare generally mild and treating these infections with low-cost topical agents should help treatment adherence. Certainty of evidence. SGLT2i have been studied in a series of large trials with consistent effects observed be-tween trials, using different agents in the class. The trialshave robust double-blind designs that minimize risk ofbias, and they have provided precise estimates of effectwith no risk of publication bias due to the Nuf \ufb01eld Department of Public Health (NDPH) Renal StudiesGroup and SGLT2 inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-RenalTrialists \u2019Consortium (SMART) collaboration, which brought together all the trialists that have conducted therelevant large trials.

For the 1A recommendation (3.7.1), also see the 2022 update to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline in DiabetesManagement for details of the certainty of the evidence. 23Our ERT speci \ufb01cally also undertook a systematic review limited to people with CKD and no diabetes and considered thecertainty of the effect in this subgroup to be moderate. TheERT identi \ufb01ed the collaborative meta-analysis, 511which included data from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2i amongadults with CKD without diabetes. 403,513Both RCTs were considered to have a low risk of", "bias. The collaborativemeta-analysis harmonized the de \ufb01nition of CKD progression among the trials. The certainty of the evidencefor CKD progression was graded as high (no concernsregarding the risk of bias of the studies or the consistency,directness, and precision of the results). The certainty of theevidence for the kidney failure outcome in people withCKD without diabetes was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision (although clear bene \ufb01ts are demonstrated in the CKD trials: Figure 24 518). Neither RCT reported on the critical outcome of hospitalizations for any cause in the subgroup without diabetes. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that fully informed people with CKD with an indication for anSGLT2i would choose to receive SGLT2i for their provenbene\ufb01ts on risk of CKD progression, AKI, and a range of cardiovascular outcomes, their generally good safety pro \ufb01le, and simplicity to implement (assuming local availabilityand insurance coverage if required). SGLT2i also conferhealth bene \ufb01ts that may motivate people with CKD due tothe reduced risk of hospitalization and serious hyper-kalemia and uric acid levels, all of which are commonCKD complications. Resource use and costs. Because of the high cost of KRT, SGLT2i have been found to be cost-saving in the people withCKD and diabetes recruited in the completed trials. 519 Generic SGLT2i are already available in some countries.From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the costburden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable,and QoL may be preserved longer from their avoidance.Speci \ufb01cs as to whether people bear the costs of these medications will be country-dependent. Considerations for implementation. The Work Group considered it safe to continue or even initiate an SGLT2iwhen the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and continue their use until the time KRT is initiated (as wasthe approach used in the large CKD populationRCTs 403,513,514). We also considered that initiating SGLT2i does not necessitate alteration of frequency of laboratorymonitoring. It is not routinely necessary to recheck blood tests after initiating an SGLT2i in adults with CKD (see Practice Point 3.7.3). 403 Reduced glomerular hyper \ufb01ltration resulting from SGLT2i can result in a dip in eGFR which is reversible.None of the large trials demonstrated an increased risk ofAKI in people treated with SGLT2i (Figure 22 ), and the intervention does not induce hyperkalemia (an importantdifference compared with inhibitors of the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone pathway, which generally require additional monitoring after initiation [Figure 21 ]). Note that adults with polycystic kidney disease were excluded from the large CKD trials testing SGLT2i.Mean baseline eGFR (ml/min/ 1.73 m2) 56 44 44 36 47 42 39 40 Diabetes CREDENCE SCORED DAPA-CKD EMPA-KIDNEY Subtotal: DIABETES No diabetes DAPA-CKD EMPA-KIDNEY Subtotal: NO DIABETES TOTAL: OVERALL 45 Relative risk (95% CI) SGLT2i Placebo Placebo 116/2202 NA/NA 77/1455 74/1525 267/5182 165/2199 NA/NA 109/1451 116/1515 390/5165 32/697 83/1779 115/2476 52/701 105/1790 157/2491 382/7658 547/7656 Events/participants Rate per 1000 patient-years SGLT2i 20 26 24 29 37 39 0.68 (0.54, 0.86) 0.69 (0.51, 0.92) 0.59 (0.44, 0.79) 0.66 (0.56, 0.77) 24 25 39 31 0.56 (0.36, 0.87) 0.80 (0.60, 1.07) 0.72 (0.56,", "0.91) 0.67 (0.59, 0.77) Heterogeneity by diabetes status: P=0.54 Trend across trials sorted by eGFR P=0.48 P=0.19 0.75 0.5 1.00 1.25 1.50 SGLT2i better Placebo better Figure 24 | Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition versus placebo on kidney failure (chronic kidney disease [CKD] trials).

Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with urine ACR<200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). This recommendation places high value on the potential for long- term use of SGLT2i in people without diabetes who have a sub-stantially decreased GFR to reduce the risk of kidney failure butrecognizes remaining uncertainty in this population due to the short follow-up in the RCTs. It also places moderate value on the bene\ufb01ts of SGLT2i on risk of AKI, cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction, and risk of hospitalization from any cause.SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, \ufb02uid overload, and the risk of serious hyperkalemia. Note that a person with CKDand heart failure has a clear indication for the use of SGLT2i toreduce risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heartfailure irrespective of level of albuminuria ( Figure 24 ). Key information Bene \ufb01ts and harms. Several large placebo-controlled RCTs have provided clear demonstrations of the ef \ufb01cacy of SGLT2i, which substantially reduce the risk of kidney disease progressionand kidney failure ( Figures 22 and24)a sw e l la sm o d e r a t e l y reduce the risk of CVD events ( Figure 23 ) in people with and without CKD. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the kidney disease progression outcome subdivided by primary kidney diagnosis demonstrated that there was no signi \ufb01cant subgroup interaction by primary kidney diagnosis, and SGLT2i reducedthe risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes(Figure 22 ). 511SGLT2i also reduce the risk of hospitalization for any cause in people with CKD.403,520Some uncertainty remains about the effects on kidney disease progression inpeople without diabetes with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/ mmol), which led to a different grading of therecommendation for that population. EMPA-KIDNEY was thekey", "trial to assess effects in people with CKD at risk ofprogression with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) and found evidence of signi \ufb01cant interaction by ACR status for its primary outcome (trend P\u00bc0.02). Relative effects appeared to be larger in people with higher levels of albuminuria. The slowrate of progression and small number of outcomes in the A1 subgroup limited the power for EMPA-KIDNEY to assess effects on the primary outcome in this subgroup. There were,however, important effects on the chronic (i.e., long-term)slope in all albuminuria subgroups, and signi \ufb01cant reductions in progression using total slope analyses over the 2 years offollow-up in the A2 and A3 groups were considered separately(Figure 25 403). Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of evidence for the ef \ufb01cacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with CKD without diabetes is moderate (see Supplementary Table S1023,403,511,518,521\u2013524). The ERT identi \ufb01ed an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis,511which included data from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor among adultswith CKD but not diabetes. 403,513Both RCTs were considered to have a low risk of bias. The IPD meta-analysis harmonizedthe de \ufb01nition of CKD progression among the trials. The certainty of the evidence for CKD progression was graded as high as there were no concerns regarding the risk of bias of the studies or the consistency, directness, and precision of theresults. The certainty of the evidence for kidney failure wasdowngraded to moderate due to imprecision. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that fully informed adults without diabetes and low levels of albuminuria(urine ACR <200 mg/g [< 20 mg/mmol]) who have established CKD and an eGFR of 20 \u201345 ml/min per 1.73 m 2may be particularly motivated to take SGLT2i for the bene \ufb01ts identi \ufb01ed on rate of decline in GFR as they already have substantiallyreduced GFR. Adults with established CKD are highly likely towant to start treatment early to maximize bene \ufb01ts. Extrapola- tion of the \ufb01ndings from eGFR slope analyses (Figure 25 ) could mean substantial delays in any future requirement for KRT.People with CKD may also be motivated by the potential forSGLT2i to reduce risk of AKI, hospitalization, serious hyperkalemia, \ufb02uid overload, and uric acid levels, all of which are common CKD complications. Resource use and costs. Health economic analyses are required in people with CKD without diabetes and low levels of albuminuria to establish their level of cost-effectiveness.From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the costburden of hospitalizations and dialysis is highly desirable, andQoL may be preserved longer from their avoidance. Speci \ufb01cs as to whether people bear the costs of these medications willbe country-dependent. Considerations for implementation.. The considerations for implementation in people with CKD and low levels of albu-minuria are no different to people with albuminuria (seeabove for details). Rationale Large trials considered individually and combined in meta-analysis demonstrate clear net bene \ufb01ts of SGLT2i, but ev- idence for bene \ufb01ts on CKD progression in people without diabetes and with low levels of albuminuria is limited toeGFR slope analyses", "in heart failure trials and one CKDtrial all with relatively short follow-up periods. However,extrapolation of these eGFR slope results suggests thatimportant bene \ufb01ts would accrue for such people if treated long term.chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S218 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. SGLT2i have not been tested in clinical trials on children with kidney disease. Limited observational data and phase II trial data exist for childrenwith and without kidney disease. Four studies (99 childrenand young adults with diabetes and normal GFR) found that pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were likely to be the same in children and adults. 525\u2013528Recent work modeled pediatric dapagli \ufb02ozin dosing for smaller children based on known pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.483Side effects reported from the prior studies included an increasein glycosuria and infrequent reporting of nausea, genitalinfection, dehydration, and abdominal pain. In an RCT,there were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis and similar numbers of hypoglycemia between placebo and dapagli \ufb02ozin, mostly occurring in those on insulin. 529There is limited research on kidney effects of SGLT2i in children. One study of 8 children with CKD and proteinuriafound a reduction in 24-hour urine protein from a mean of 2.1g/d to a mean of 1.5 g/d over 12 weeks. 530Theoretically, the glycosuric effect of SGLT2i may lead to a negative caloriebalance, interfering with optimal growth, especially in smallchildren with underlying growth retardation. Clinical trials inthe pediatric population are suggested, including in thosewith speci \ufb01c etiologies and at different age groups (i.e., prepubescent, peripubescent, and postpubescent). 3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practicepoints from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease . 23\u20131 \u20130.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2Mean annual rate of change in estimated GFR (ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year) Empagliflozin Placebo Absolute difference (95% CI) Placebo better Empagliflozin betterDiabetes Present \u20132.01 (0.11) \u20132.30 (0.10)\u20132.91 (0.11)\u20132.92 (0.10)0.90 (0.59, 1.21)0.62 (0.33, 0.91) Absent \u20132.64 (0.13) \u20132.59 (0.11) \u20134.04 (0.17)0.51 (0.15, 0.87) 0.73 (0.42, 1.05) 1.21 (0.76, 1.67)Estimated GFR (m l/min per 1.73 m2) <30 \u20132.12 (0.13) \u226530 <45 \u20131.86 (0.11) \u226545 \u20132.83 (0.16) Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (mg/g) <30 \u20130.72 (0.16) \u20131.19 (0.13) \u20133.22 (0.10)\u20130.88 (0.16) \u20131.64 (0.13) \u20134.42 (0.10)0.17 (\u20130.27, 0.60) 0.46 (0.09, 0.83)1.19 (0.92, 1.47)\u226530 \u2264300 >300 All participants \u20132.16 (0.08) \u20132.92 (0.08) 0.75 (0.54, 0.96) Diabetes Present \u20131.05 (0.12) \u20131.66 (0.11)\u20132.73 (0.12)\u20132.75 (0.11)1.68 (1.36, 2.00)1.09 (0.79, 1.39) Absent \u20132.85 (0.14) \u20132.50 (0.12) \u20133.60 (0.17)1.01 (0.63, 1.39) 1.32 (0.99, 1.65) 2.01 (1.53, 2.49)Estimated GFR (m l/min per 1.73 m2) <30 \u20131.84 (0.14) \u226530<45 \u20131.18 (0.12) \u226545 \u20131.58 (0.17) Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (mg/g) <30 \u20130.11 (0.17) \u20130.49 (0.14) \u20132.35 (0.11)\u20130.89 (0.16) \u20131.69 (0.14) \u20134.11 (0.11)0.78 (0.32, 1.23) 1.20 (0.81, 1.59) 1.76 (1.46, 2.05)\u226530 \u2264300 >300 All participants \u20131.37 (0.08) \u20132.75 (0.08) 1.37 (1.16, 1.59)Long-term slopeSubgroup Total slope Figure 25 | Effects of empagli \ufb02ozin versus placebo on annual rate of change in estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (GFR) by key subgroups in the Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagli \ufb02ozin (EMPA-KIDNEY).

Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are mostappropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk ofCKD progression and cardiovascular events, asdemonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies. Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults. Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyper- kalemia, select people with consistently normal serumpotassium concentration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA (Figure 26 ). Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene \ufb01ts. Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroidal MRA may be used for treatment of heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, or re- fractory hypertension, but may cause hyperkalemia or areversible decline in glomerular \ufb01ltration, particularly among people with a low GFR. MRAs reduce BP and albuminuria in people with CKD 531 and are part of recommended care for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.532The large Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in DiabeticKidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) 533and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in DiabeticKidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) 534placebo-controlled trials and their pooled analysis (FIDELITY)535demonstrated thatthe nonsteroidal MRA (ns-MRA) \ufb01nerenone reduced cardiovascular risk in people with CKD and T2D (HR: 0.86;95% CI: 0.78 \u20130.95). The bene \ufb01t was in large part due to a 22% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure(HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66 \u20130.92), with no clear effect on stroke (Figure 27 ). 535These trials have some limitations on their generalizability to all people with CKD at risk of progression,given that study participants had an eGFR of $25 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and an ACR of $30 mg/g ( $3m g / m m o l ) ,a n d that people without diabetes were excluded. Whether based on laboratory data or investigator reports, \ufb01nerenone approximately doubled the RR of hyperkalemia compared with controls. However, risks were generally lowand average increase in serum potassium was approximately0.2\u20130.3 mEq from baseline values. The low absolute baseline risk of hyperkalemia may be due to the selection of partic-ipants with serum potassium <4.8 mmol/l and careful algorithmic monitoring of potassium during follow-up.Speci \ufb01c analyses of FIDELIO-DKD reported that 2.3% and 11.0% of participants in the \ufb01nerenone group withdrew or interrupted treatment due to hyperkalemia (de \ufb01ned as serum potassium >5.5 mmol/l), respectively, versus 0.9% and 5.2% for the placebo", "group. 535Overall, in FIDELITY, permanent treatment withdrawal forhyperkalemia was 1.7% versus 0.6%.

Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA shouldprioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts.Results of the FLOW trial assessing effects of GLP-1 RA in a dedicated CKD population are awaited. It", "is a de \ufb01nitive assessment of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in 3534 people with CKD, albuminuria, and T2D. 537aNevertheless, extrapolating current evidence from trials in people withT2D where kidney function was generally preserved suggests GLP-1 RA safely improve glycemic control and may reduce weight and risk of CVD in people withCKD. 23,538Meta-analysis of these large, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome GLP-1 RA trials has shown reducedMACE in people with prior CVD or at high risk. 538The size of RR reductions on cardiovascular risk appears similarin people with or without decreased GFR. 538Once aggregated, GLP-1 RAs were shown to have modestly reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82 \u20130.92) and separately reduced risk of death from any cause (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82 \u20130.94).538The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Kidney Disease has recommendedthat long-acting GLP-1 RAs are prioritized ahead of insulinin people with T2D and CKD.

Metabolicacidosis is observationally associated with increased risk ofprotein catabolism, muscle wasting, in \ufb02ammation, and other complications such as impaired cardiac function and mor-tality that are also associated with decreased eGFR. 539,540The causality of such associations remains to be demonstrated. De\ufb01nition and prevalence. Serum bicarbonate concentration begins to fall progressively once eGFR falls below 60 ml/minper 1.73 m2with reductions most evident in CKD stages G4 \u2013 G5 ( Figure 28 ,541Table 23 ). The adjusted adult prevalence of serum bicarbonate <22 mmol/l was 7.7% and 6.7% in those with and without diabetes at stage G3, A1, respectively, increasing to 38.3% and 35.9% by CKD stage G5, A3. Practice Point 3.10.1: In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary inter-vention to prevent development of acidosis with potentialclinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2: Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonateconcentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal anddoes not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or\ufb02uid status. The Work Group has not provided a graded recommen- dation for the treatment of acidosis due to a lack of large-scaleRCTs supporting its use. In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justi\ufb01ed because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-bene \ufb01t adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. This was based on an RCT that had suggested potential kidney disease progressionand nutritional bene \ufb01ts with no important increase in BP or heart failure complications. 1However, since 2012, a number of trials testing the hypothesis that sodium bicarbonatetherapy would slow kidney disease progression have been reported, including several employing placebo control. A 2021 systematic review identi \ufb01ed 15 trials with $3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no studymedication on kidney outcomes. Of the 15 trials (2445participants, median follow-up 12 months), 11 werepublished since 2012. The totality of the evidence remains limited by a", "low number of outcomes, and meta-analysis restricted to the placebo-controlled trials does not con \ufb01rm any important modifying effect of oral sodium bicarbonateversus placebo on risk of kidney failure (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.54\u20131.22). 542The largest placebo-controlled trial of oral sodium bicarbonate was conducted by the Clinical andcost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate therapy for \u20135\u20134\u20133\u20132\u201311 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 12 0 eGFR, ml/min/1.73 m2Serum bicarbonate, mmol/lA1 A2 A3 Figure 28 | Association between estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) with serum bicarbonate concentration in general population and high-risk cohorts from the Chronic KidneyDisease Prognosis Consortium, by level of albuminuria (A1 \u2013A3).

Importantly, the BiCARB trial, which studied people with CKD G3 \u2013G4 aged $60 years and sodium bicarbonate concentration <22 mmol/l, also found no evidence of bene \ufb01t on nonkidney outcomes to support oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (the primary outcome was based on the Short PhysicalPerformance Battery at 12 months, and secondary outcomesincluded generic and disease-speci \ufb01c QoL assessments, anthropometry, kidney function, walk distance, BP, andbone and vascular health markers). Allocation to oralsodium bicarbonate was associated with higher costs andlower European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 LevelVersion (EQ-5D-3L) assessed QoL over 1 year. 543 Licensed non-alkali oral", "interventions may be an alterna- tive to oral sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis buthave not been shown to have particular advantages. 544,545 Although placebo-controlled trials have found no goodevidence that correcting sodium bicarbonate levels hasimportant effects on clinical outcomes, the Work Groupconcluded that the intervention is clearly effective atincreasing serum bicarbonate concentration and is asuitable treatment to avoid more severe acidosis withpotential for clinical implications. The Work Group suggeststhat a serum bicarbonate of <18 mmol/l in adults is desirable to avoid, but large RCTs are required to determinea precise threshold whereby the treatment of low serumbicarbonate levels leads to improvements in clinicaloutcome. As correction of bicarbonate to the normal rangehas not been demonstrated to reduce the risk of kidneyfailure, lower thresholds to initiate therapy than 18 mmol/lcould be considered (see Research Recommendations ). Dietary approaches. Dietary modi \ufb01cations that limit the consumption of acid-rich foods and/or increase the intake ofalkaline-rich foods reduce the net endogenous acid productionand can serve as an additional strategy to control metabolicacidosis in people with CKD. 546,547Such diets are generally low in animal protein or have a higher consumption of plant-basedfoods over animal-based foods (i.e., plant-dominant diets suchas Mediterranean or vegetarian diets). Four small RCTs ofalkaline-rich plant-based diets in adults with CKDdemonstrate a comparable bene \ufb01tt oo r a ls o d i u m bicarbonate in controlling metabolic acidosis. 548\u2013551 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. As in adults, children with CKD often have metabolic acidosis. In the CKiD and the Cardio- vascular Comorbidity in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease Study (4C) studies, 38% \u201360% of children had a serum bicar- bonate of <22 mmol/l, varying by CKD category. Low bicar- bonate was associated with increased risk of diseaseprogression. 395,552It should also be noted that for younger children, the normal range for sodium bicarbonate is as lowas 17 mmol/l. In children, metabolic acidosis is also likely tocause growth retardation. Data from the observational CKiD study revealed that prepubertal children with acidosis who were treated with alkali had improved growth. 553In children with normal GFR but renal tubular acidosis, prolongedacidosis can also result in poor growth. The KDOQIguideline on bone metabolism for children with CKDrecommends the prevention of acidosis in children tooptimize growth. 554There have not been any trials examining the effect of bicarbonate supplementation on CKD progression or growth in children. 3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD De\ufb01nition and prevalence. Potassium is key to cell mem- brane electrophysiology, with abnormalities predisposing to abnormal cardiac conduction and arrhythmias. The kidneysplay a key role in potassium homeostasis with decreased GFRgenerally associated with increased potassium concentration(Table 24 ;Figure 29 555). The de \ufb01nition of hyperkalemia is based on the distribution of potassium values in the generalpopulation. Hyperkalemia is uncommon when the eGFR is>60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and increases with lower GFR. Adults with CKD G3, A1 in the general and high-risk pop- ulation cohorts, contributing to the CKD-PC, had an adjustedprevalence of hyperkalemia (de \ufb01ned as a serum potassium >5.0 mmol/l) of 8.8% and 4.5% in those with and without", "diabetes, respectively, increasing to 34.4% and 23.7% by CKDG5, A3 (Figure 30 ). 541Note that there is variability in the prevalence of hyperkalemia, and it is not inevitable at lower Table 24 | Variation of laboratory values in a large population databaseaby age group, sex, and eGFR; potassium, mmol/l, mean (SD), and n [4,278,600 Measure, mean (SD) Age (yr) SexGFR category (ml/min per 1.73 m2) 105D 90\u2013104 75 \u201389 60 \u201374 45 \u201359 30 \u201344 15 \u201329 0 \u201314 Serum potassium $65 Female 4.1 (0.5) 4.2 (1.3) 4.2 (0.5) 4.3 (0.5) 4.3 (1.3) 4.4 (0.5) 4.5 (1.0) 4.5 (2.0) Male 4.2 (0.5) 4.3 (0.6) 4.3 (1.1) 4.4 (0.6) 4.4 (0.7) 4.5 (1.1) 4.6 (0.6) 4.6 (1.6) <65 Female 4.1 (0.7) 4.2 (1.3) 4.3 (17.0) 4.2 (1.0) 4.3 (0.5) 4.3 (0.6) 4.4 (0.6) 4.5 (1.1) Male 4.2 (0.4) 4.3 (0.5) 4.3 (0.6) 4.3 (0.4) 4.4 (0.5) 4.5 (0.6) 4.5 (0.7) 4.6 (0.7) eGFR, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate. aData from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a longitudinal, real-world data asset with deidenti \ufb01ed administrative claims and electronic health record data.

Hyperkalemia in people with preserved GFR is less prev- alent. An acute episode of hyperkalemia is a potassium resultabove the upper limit of normal that is not known to bechronic. At the current time, there is no consensus on themagnitude, duration, and frequency of elevated potassiumvalues that de \ufb01ne chronicity. 556In addition to decreased eGFR, other risk factors for hyperkalemia included higherACR and prior diabetes, hyperglycemia, constipation,RASi, 557and MRA.536Note that SGLT2i do not appear to increase serum potassium values.403,517 Studies have demonstrated a continuous U-shaped rela- tionship between serum potassium and all-cause mortalityin a range of different populations (Figure 31 ). 555,558It has also been associated with worse kidney prognosis.559 Observationally, the risk of death from the same degree ofhyperkalemia is lower in more advanced CKD stages. 560\u2013564 This may suggest that there are adaptive mechanisms thatrender better tolerance to elevated levels of potassium incirculation. 561,565\u2013568 3.11.1 Awareness of factors impacting on potassium measurement There are several factors and mechanisms that may impact on potassium measurements, including the actions of medicationsthat can increase the risk of developing hyperkalemia.

See Section 4.3for more information on continuing RASi after hyperkalemia events. 3.11.2 Potassium exchange agents Practice Point 3.11.2.1: Be aware of local availability or formulary restrictions with regard to the pharmacologicmanagement of nonemergent hyperkalemia. The pharmacologic management of nonemergent hyper- kalemia has a number of clinical tools with the increasednumber of licensed potassium exchange agents. These med-ications have differing mechanisms of action, onsets of clin-ical effects, and potential medication and disease-state interactions ( Table 27 581,582). Although the classic potassium exchange agents have had tolerability issues, the newer ones appear to have fewer such issues and appear relatively safewhen used long term. 575,583,584Use of these newer exchange agents may help facilitate essential use of RASi/MRA.However, it is important that the healthcare provider beaware of clinical nuances and local availability or formularyrestrictions in determining therapy selection. 583A comparison of available potassium exchange agents can befound in Table 27 . 3.11.3 Timing to recheck potassium after identifying moder- ate and severe hyperkalemia in adults \u201cThink Kidneys \u201dand the UK Kidney Association have pro- vided a practical guide, which we have adapted ( Table 28 )f o r repeat testing after a hyperkalemic episode.585The timing of repeat testing is guided by the level of hyperkalemia and the clinical context.5863.11.4 Managing hyperkalemia In people with CKD and the management of nonemergent hyperkalemia, a systematic approach of treating correctable factors (e.g., correction of severe metabolic acidosis) andunderstanding the role of diet and medications may providea pragmatic framework. Figure 32 shows a stepwise practical approach to the management of hyperkalemia inCKD. 3.11.5 Dietary considerations In early stages of CKD, high intake of foods naturally rich inpotassium appears to be protective against disease progres-sion, and dietary restriction of foods naturally containingpotassium, such as fruits and vegetables, may be harmful tocardiac health; therefore, such restriction is not endorsed. 587 Practice Point 3.11.5.1: Implement an individualizedapproach in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5 and emergent hyperkalemia that includes dietary and pharmacologic in-terventions and takes into consideration associatedcomorbidities and quality of life (QoL). Assessment andeducation through a renal dietitian or an accreditednutrition provider are advised. Practice Point 3.11.5.2: Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods)for people with CKD G3 \u2013G5 who have a history of hyperkalemia or as a prevention strategy during diseaseperiods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern. Diet may increase serum potassium postprandially, 575,588 but other conditions such as the use of potassium-sparingTable 26 | Medications associated with increased risk of hyperkalemia Class Mechanism Example ACEi Inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II Captopril, lisinopril, perindopril, etc. ARB Inhibit activation of angiotensin I receptor by angiotensin II Losartan, irbesartan, candesartan, etc. Aldosterone antagonist Block aldosterone receptor activation Spironolactone, eplerenone, and \ufb01nerenone b-Adrenergic receptor blockerInhibit renin release Propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol Digitalis glycoside Inhibit Na\u00fe-K\u00fe-ATPase, necessary for collecting duct K\u00fesecretion Digoxin Heparin Reduced production", "of aldosterone Heparin sodium Potassium-sparing diureticBlock collecting duct apical Na\u00fechannel, decreasing gradient for K\u00fesecretion Amiloride and triamterene NSAIDs Inhibit synthesis of prostaglandin E and prostacyclin, inhibiting renin release Ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, etc. CNI Inhibit Na\u00fe-K\u00fe-ATPase, necessary for collecting duct K\u00fesecretion Cyclosporine and tacrolimus ns-MRA Block MR-mediated Na\u00fereabsorption Finerenone Other Block collecting duct apical Na\u00fechannel, decreasing gradient for K\u00fesecretion Trimethoprim and pentamidine ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; CNI, calcineurin inhibitor; K\u00fe, potassium; Na\u00fe, sodium; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-in \ufb02ammatory drug; ns-MRA, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

Cooking methods such as soaking foods for 5 \u201310 minutes in previously boiled water can effectively reduce the potas-sium by half for some foods. 599Thus, educating peoplewith CKD and healthcare providers, using clear messaging,on dietary approaches to potassium management isneeded ( https://www.theisn.org/initiatives/toolkits/raasi-toolkit/ #1684867542809-330edb79-52b4 ), as well as a policy to improve food labeling by detailing the added potassium usedin processing. Special considerations International considerations. For people with CKD and severe recurrent hyperkalemia (potassium >6 mmol/l), the balance to be considered is between the additional cost ofthe number needed to treat with potassium exchange agentsto prevent additional costs of hyperkalemia over and aboveCKD management costs. If the price for potassium-loweringtherapy is lower than the reduction of inpatient and outpatient costs due to prevented hyperkalemia, the cost- bene\ufb01t ratio will be favorable because in addition to the health bene \ufb01ts, there is a net saving of healthcare costs resulting from potassium-lowering treatment. The key is toimplement a successful affordable strategy for hyperkalemiamanagement that allows the maintenance of other therapies3rd line: Last resort1st", "line: Address correctable factors 2nd line: Medications\u2022 Review non-RASi medications (e.g. NSAIDs, trimethoprim) \u2022 Assess dietary potassium intake (dietary referral) and consider appropriate moderation of dietary potassium intake Consider: \u2022 Appropriate use of diuretics \u2022 Optimize serum bicarbonate levels\u2022 Licensed potassium exchange agents \u2022 Reduce dose or discontinue RASi/MRA (Discontinuation is associated with increased cardiovascular events.

Pediatric considerations. As described for adults with CKD, abnormal serum potassium levels are also commonly seen in children with advanced stages of CKD, as well as those with glomerular disorders, metabolic acidosis, and those onRASi. 600In addition, a small group of children with CKD can have persistent hypokalemia, usually as a result of inherited oracquired renal tubular disorders. In children with CKD, discontinuation of RASi was asso- ciated with an acceleration of kidney function declinecompared with a matched control cohort of children in whom RASi were continued. 395 In children with CKD, the dietary management of potas- sium can pose unique challenges as the provision of adequate energy, protein, and micronutrients for growth cannot becompromised, and specialized low potassium nutritionalformulas may not be widely available or palatable. 601 An example of a patient resource (for children and their caregivers) for potassium management can be found at: Nutrition taskforce \u2014European Society for Paediatric Nephrology (https://www.espn-online.org/ ). 3.12 Anemia The KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease will be updated in 2024.436 Mean hemoglobin is, on average, lower in both men and women with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2compared with health adults and progressively falls with decreasing GFR (Table 29 ;Figure 34541). For example, adults with CKD G3, A1 in the general and high-risk population cohorts contributing to the CKD-PC had an adjusted prevalence ofanemia (hemoglobin <12 g/dl in men; <11 g/dl in women) of 14.9% and 11.5% in those with and without diabetes,respectively, and this prevalence increased to 60.7% and57.4% by CKD G5, A3. Note that a drop in Hb is expectedin pregnancy (physiologic anemia) and may not warrant treatment (although the cutoff at which treatment is desirable is unclear and", "requires clinical judgment). Pleaserefer to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemiain Chronic Kidney Disease publications for speci \ufb01c recommendations, selection, and dosing of speci \ufb01c therapeutic agents, as well as research recommendations.3.13 CKD-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) The Work Group highlights the KDIGO 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline Update for the Diagnosis, Evaluation, Prevention,and Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease \u2013Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD). 20Please refer to this publication for speci\ufb01c recommendations, selection, dosing of speci \ufb01c therapeutic agents, and research recommendations. Changes in bone mineral metabolism and alterations in calcium and phosphate homeostasis occur early in the courseof CKD and progress as eGFR declines ( Figure 35 541). These are detectable as abnormalities of serum calcium, phosphate,vitamin D metabolites, and circulating hormones (i.e., parathyroid hormone [PTH] and \ufb01broblast growth factor- 23). These changes are grouped under the umbrella term CKD-MBD, which also includes renal osteodystrophy and Table 29 | Variation of laboratory values in a large population databaseaby age group, sex, and eGFR; hemoglobin, g/dl, mean (SD), and n [3,561,622 Measure, mean (SD) Age (yr) SexGFR category (ml/min per 1.73 m2) 105D 90\u2013104 75 \u201389 60 \u201374 45 \u201359 30 \u201344 15 \u201329 0 \u201314 Hemoglobin $65 Female 12.2 (2.0) 13.2 (4.6) 13.2 (1.7) 13.2 (1.5) 12.8 (1.6) 12.1 (1.7) 11.2 (1.8) 10.3 (1.7) Male 12.9 (2.4) 14.2 (1.8) 14.2 (1.7) 14.1 (1.8) 13.5 (1.9) 12.7 (2.0) 11.5 (2.0) 10.5 (2.0) <65 Female 13.0 (1.4) 13.3 (1.3) 13.4 (2.0) 13.4 (1.4) 13.0 (1.6) 12.1 (1.8) 11.0 (1.9) 10.6 (2.5) Male 14.9 (1.5) 15.0 (3.1) 15.0 (1.4) 14.9 (1.6) 14.1 (2.0) 12.9 (2.2) 11.7 (2.2) 10.9 (2.0) eGFR, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate. aData from the Optum Labs Data Warehouse, a longitudinal, real-world data asset with deidenti \ufb01ed administrative claims and electronic health record data.

Uric acid is the end product of the metabolism of purine compounds, and both increased urate production and decreased kidney excretion of uric acid can leadto hyperuricemia. The American College of Rheumatologyde\ufb01nes hyperuricemia as a serum uric acid concentration of $6.8 mg/dl (approximately $400 mmol/l).607 Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Exami- nation Survey (NHANES) 2015 \u20132016 found that the crude adult prevalence of gout (de \ufb01ned as self-reported, doctor diagnosis, or uric acid \u2013lowering therapy use) was 3.9% with a higher prevalence in men than women (5.2% vs. 2.7%). Afteradjustment for age and sex, an eGFR consistent with CKD G3was associated with about twice the prevalence of gout (oddsratio: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.05 \u20133.66). 608Recommendation 3.14.1: We recommend people with CKD and symptomatic hyperuricemia should be offered uric acid \u2013lowering intervention (1C). The Work Group placed high value on avoiding the un- pleasant symptoms of acute gout and preventing long-termcomplications of recurrent gout among people with CKD.There are well-tolerated and low-cost oral medications thatcan effectively lower blood uric acid concentration in peoplewith CKD. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. Systematic review of the management of gout by the American College of Rheu-matology found strong evidence for uric acid lowering inpeople with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due togout, or frequent gout \ufb02ares; some of whom also had CKD. 607 The ERT assessed the safety of uric acid \u2013lowering therapy and found that uric acid lowering did not increase adverseevents among people with CKD and particularly focused onrisk of cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivity (pooled RR:1.00; 95% CI: 0.60 \u20131.65) and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37 \u20132.30). Uric acid \u2013lowering therapy was also found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in people with CKD. 150,609,610This reassuring cardiovascular safety pro \ufb01le is consistent with general population data. In the open-label Allopurinol andCardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Ischemic HeartDisease (ALL-HEART) randomized trial, 5721 people aged$60 years with ischemic heart disease but no history of gout were included. Allopurinol did not modifycardiovascular risk compared with standard care (HR forthe composite primary outcome of nonfatal myocardialinfarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.89 \u20131.21).

The overall certainty of the evidence for uric acid \u2013lowering therapy among people with CKD and hyperuricemia is very low (see Supplementary Table S11150,612\u2013614). The critical outcome of delaying progression of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615\u2013619The 2 largest RCTs were considered to have a low risk of bias.615,616The certainty of the evidence was downgraded for inconsistencybecause there was substantial statistical heterogeneity detected in the meta-analysis (I 2\u00bc50%) and the estimated RRs ranged from 0.05 to 2.96. The certainty of the evidence was further downgraded because of very seriousimprecision. There were 81 kidney failure events among theparticipants in the 7 trials. The overall certainty of the evidence for delaying pro- gression is very low, and the certainty for the critical harmoutcomes, such as cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity, and hepatotoxicity, was graded as low. However, the certainty of evidence for uric acid \u2013lowering interventions in reducing frequency and severity of gout attack, and limiting tophaceousdeposition is consistently high, so the recommendation isgiven an overall grade of level C. Values and preferences. People with gout have reported that they were initially hesitant to start uric acid \u2013lowering therapy, but that after experiencing improved control of in\ufb02ammatory symptoms and tophi, they became strong advocates for its earlier institution.607 Resource use and costs. There are several generic xanthine oxidase inhibitors that are well tolerated and widely available at low cost. Considerations for implementation. In most countries, the cost and availability of uric acid \u2013lowering therapies make the medications very accessible. The risk of serious adverse events (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) is related to the presence of speci \ufb01c human leukocyte antigen (HLA) *B5801, which is more common in those of Han Chinese,Korean, Thai, and African descent. In speci \ufb01c", "regions, assessment of the HLA type is recommended beforecommencing the drug; where testing is not available, closemonitoring at initiation of the medication should be un-dertaken. At the current time, there is no indication to commence medication for high serum uric acid levels in the absence of symptoms. Rationale Uric acid \u2013lowering therapy reduces uric acid levels and their associated symptomatic joint and skin complications, and aregenerally safe to use.Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid \u2013lowering therapy for people with CKD after their \ufb01rst episode of gout (particularly where there is no avoidable precipitant or serumuric acid concentration is >9m g / d l[ 5 3 5 mmol/l]). Although the initiation of uric acid \u2013lowering therapy in people with a \ufb01rst gouty arthritis episode and no tophi was not recommended by the American College of Rheumatology,uric acid \u2013lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5, serum uric acid concentration >9 mg/dl ( >535 mmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their \ufb01rst episode of gout. This was justi \ufb01ed by the higher risk of gout progression and development of clinical tophi in CKD.607The ERT evidence review identi \ufb01ed that uric acid \u2013 lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout \ufb02are during the \ufb01rst 3 months after initiation in people with CKD. This is an expected short-term risk of uric acid lowering that people should be counseled about wheninitiating such therapy. Two relatively small randomizedtrials have suggested that starting uric acid \u2013lowering therapy during a gout \ufb02are does not appear to extend \ufb02are duration. 620,621Once initiated, the American College of Rheumatology suggests continuing uric acid \u2013lowering therapy inde \ufb01nitely.607 Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitorsin preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD andsymptomatic hyperuricemia. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol and febuxostat) reduce serum uric acid concentration by reducingpurine metabolism into uric acid. Uricosuric agents enhanceits urinary excretion (probenecid is an example), but theireffect is blunted in the context of reduced GFR. Note that theCardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Par-ticipants With Gout and Cardiovascular Comorbidities(CARES) double-blind randomized trial of allopurinol versusfebuxostat in 6190 people with gout and prior CVD found that these 2 interventions were noninferior with respect to the composite primary cardiovascular outcome. However, overallmortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher in thefebuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (HR for deathfrom any cause: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01 \u20131.47 and HR for car- diovascular death: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03 \u20131.73). 622In people with T2D, post hoc analyses from 2 large, placebo-controlled RCTs have reported that SGLT2i reduce serum uric acid concentration and appeared to reduce gout adverse event reports or initiations of uric acid \u2013lowering therapy.515,623 Observational studies suggest that diuretics (thiazide andloop) increase serum uric acid concentration. 624The effect is mediated through multiple potential kidney-centeredmechanisms, which are summarized in a review of drug-induced hyperuricemia. 625www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S231 Practice Point 3.14.3: For symptomatic treatment of acute gout in CKD, low-dose colchicine", "or intra-articular/oralglucocorticoids are preferable to nonsteroidal anti-in \ufb02am- matory drugs (NSAIDs). The American College of Rheumatology recommended that colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids are preferred \ufb01rst-line therapies for acute gout treatment based on demonstrated highlevels of evidence for ef \ufb01cacy, low cost, and tolerability. 607 Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. Forcolchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg anhour later, with ongoing anti-in \ufb02ammatory therapy until the \ufb02are resolves) was highlighted. 607Dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. Anti-in \ufb02ammatory treatment may be useful as prophylaxis against a symptomatic \ufb02are when initiating uric acid \u2013lowering therapy and may sometimes be required long term (without diarrhea). We have advised thatlow-dose colchicine is preferable to NSAIDs given the safetyand tolerability pro \ufb01le and may also reduce risk of cardiovascular events. 626In contrast, NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously.627Short courses of glucocorticoids titrated to symptoms response (e.g., 30 mgprednisolone orally for 3 \u20135d a y s )c o u l db eu s e da sa na l t e r n a t i v e . Dietary approaches. Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventionswhich may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol,meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. High alcohol intake, high purine intake, and consumption of carbonated drinks are associated with higher levels ofserum uric acid. Consumption of these products in higheramounts is associated with both higher levels and goutsymptoms. In contrast, diets that are low in fat and dairy, andhigh \ufb01ber, plant-based diets are associated with lower inci- dence of gout. Thus, diet modi \ufb01cation may be of value in people with CKD, high uric acid, and gout. Serum uric acid levels among people with a history of gout are higher in those with higher versus moderate levels ofalcohol intake ($ 30 units/wk vs. <20 units/wk), as is the risk of recurrence. 624,628The odds of gout also appear higher among those with higher median purine intake ( $850 mg vs.<850 mg estimated purine intake in the last 24 hours).624 Experimentally, 2 hours after ingestion of 1 g/kg of bodyweight of fructose, serum uric acid concentration increases by 1\u20132m g / d l( 5 9 . 5 \u2013119 mmol/l),629and its consumption in carbonated drinks is observationally associated with higher serum uric acid concentration levels,630,631and incident gout (whereas diet versions of these drinks are not).632Foods associated with a low incidence of gout include low-fat dairy,and high- \ufb01ber and plant-based diets. 633 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. There are no uric acid \u2013lowering trials in children. International considerations. Asian (as opposed to African and Caucasian) ethnicities may be at higher risk of seriousskin cutaneous reactions if they carry the HLA-B*5801 allele. It has been suggested that HLA-B*5801 allele screening may be considered in people who will be treated with allopurinol(although there is uncertainty that screening would be cost- effective). 634 Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKDand asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay", "CKD progression (2D). The Work Group judged that most well-informed people with CKD would prefer to optimize medical therapies that have proven bene \ufb01t for CKD progression, and that the evidence does not support treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify risk of CKD progression. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. On balance, despite obser- vational studies implicating elevated serum uric acid levels inthe progression of CKD, the data from systematic reviews andmultiple RCTs do not support treatment in the absence ofsymptoms. Given the pill burden and lack of data, there islittle support for the use of uric acid \u2013lowering agents. Observational data that implicate elevated serum uric acidlevels in the progression of CKD have not been shown to re\ufb02ect causal associations, 635,636as RCTs evaluating uric acid lowering on progression of CKD do not demonstrate clear bene\ufb01t on progression, including data summarized in a Cochrane systematic review comprising 12 RCTs that hadrandomized 1187 participants. 609Since the 2017 Cochrane review, 3 large, important RCTs with negative results havebeen conducted in people with CKD and asymptomatichyperuricemia ( Table 30 ). 615,616,637 The ERT review identi \ufb01ed 25 studies (26 publications) that compared a uric acid \u2013lowering therapy with placebo, usual care, or another uric acid \u2013lowering therapy among people with CKD and hyperuricemia.150,612\u2013619,622,637\u2013652Twenty-two studies (23 publications)150,612\u2013619,622,637\u2013652were new studies published since the Cochrane review or were not captured bythe Cochrane 2017 review. 609We did not include 9 studies from the Sampson et al.609review because they did not include a separate analysis among people with CKD orbecause the study was reported as a meeting abstract only.Among people with CKD and hyperuricemia, the effects ofuric acid \u2013lowering therapy compared with placebo or usual care were unclear in terms of progression of kidney failure(pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.43 \u20131.98 for studies ranged in follow-up from 3 months to 7 years), cutaneous reactionsand hypersensitivity (pooled RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.60 \u20131.65), and hepatotoxicity (pooled RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.37 \u20132.30). Lastly, within the various therapies among people with CKDand hyperuricemia, the effects of febuxostat compared withbenzbromarone on cutaneous reactions and hypersensitivitywere unclear (RR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.01 \u20134.01).chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S232 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Certainty of the evidence. The overall certainty of the evi- dence for uric acid \u2013lowering therapy among people with CKD and hyperuricemia is very low. The critical outcome of delaying the progression of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615\u2013619 The certainty of the evidence was downgraded forinconsistency because there was some statistical heterogeneitydetected in our meta-analysis ( Supplementary Table S12 615\u2013619,637,638,640,642,651,653). The certainty of the evidence was further downgraded because of very serious imprecision, asthere were few events in the trials. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that most well-informed people with CKD would prefer to optimizemedical therapies that have proven bene \ufb01t for CKD pro- gression, and that there is little evidence to support thetreatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia to modify the risk of CKD progression. Resource use and costs. There are no cost considerations, beyond", "cost-savings, in our recommendation not to use uric acid\u2013lowering agents. Considerations for implementation. There are no imple- mentation considerations in our recommendation not to useuric acid \u2013lowering agents.Rationale There is insuf \ufb01cient evidence to recommend the use of uric acid\u2013lowering therapies in asymptomatic hyperuricemia for the speci \ufb01c purpose of delaying CKD progression. We make the recommendation not giving uric acid \u2013lowering therapy in asymptomatic hyperuricemia for slowing of kidney diseasebased on the current evidence that suggests unclear bene \ufb01ts. We judge that it is best practice not to expose people tomedications that provide little bene \ufb01t. 3.15 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional speci \ufb01c interventions to modify risk Prevalence and diagnosis. People with CKD are at increased risk of CVD,654,655a key feature of which is structural heart disease, heart failure, and sudden death.656\u2013658Increased risk of atherosclerotic disease also accompanies CKD.654These risks increase progressively as eGFR declines ( Figure 3612).4 Risk of death from CVD exceeds the risk of progression to kidney failure for the majority of people with CKD. The diagnosis of cardiac disease can be more complex and challenging in CKD, with many standard tests needing carefulTable 30 | Randomized controlled trials in the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in people with CKD Study (N) CKD populationIntervention (follow-up) Outcome CKD-FIX615(N\u00bc369) CKD G3 \u2013G4, mean ACR 717 mg/g (81 mg/mmol), mean urate 8.2 mg/dl (490 mmol/l)Allopurinol vs. placebo (104 wk)No signi \ufb01cant difference in eGFR decline, /C03.33 vs. /C03.23 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr PERL Study group616 (N\u00bc530)eGFR 40 \u201399.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and type 1 diabetesAllopurinol vs. placebo (3 yr)No signi \ufb01cant difference in mGFR decline, /C03.0 vs. /C02.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr FEATHER Study637 (N\u00bc467)CKD G3 Febuxostat vs. placebo (108 wk)No signi \ufb01cant difference in eGFR slope 0.23/C65.26 vs. /C00.47/C64.4.8 ml/min per 1.73 m2 ACR, albumin-to-creatinine ratio; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKD-FIX, Controlled Trial of Slowing of Kidney Disease Progression from the Inhibition of Xanthine Oxidase; eGFR, estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; FEATHER, Febuxostat vs. Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial Regarding Reduced Renal Function in Patients With Hyperuricemia Complicated by Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3; PERL, Preventing Early Renal Loss in Diabetes. 105+ 90\u2013104 60\u201389 45\u201359 30\u201344 15\u201329 <15<10 10\u201329 30\u2013299 300\u2013999 1000+Overall eGFRcrACR (mg/g) All-cause mortality: 82 cohorts Study size = 26,444,384; events = 2,604,028105+ 90\u2013104 60\u201389 45\u201359 30\u201344 15\u201329 <15<10 10\u201329 30\u2013299 300\u2013999 1000+Overall eGFRcrACR (mg/g) Cardiovascular mortality: 76 cohorts Study size = 26,022,346; events = 776,4411.6 2.2 2.9 4.3 5.8 Ref 1.3 1.8 2.6 3.1 1.0 1.3 1.7 2.2 2.8 1.3 1.6 2.0 2.4 3.1 1.8 2.0 2.5 3.2 3.9 2.8 2.8 3.3 4.1 5.6 4.6 5.0 5.3 6.0 7.01.4 2.0 3.0 4.1 5.4 Ref 1.3 1.9 2.7 3.6 1.0 1.4 1.7 2.4 3.2 1.4 1.7 2.2 2.8 3.8 2.0 2.3 2.8 3.7 4.6 3.2 3.1 3.5 5.0 6.5 6.1 6.4 6.4 7.3 8.2 Figure 36 | Risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by estimated glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) and level of albuminuria from general population cohorts contributing to the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium.

Perceived risks of contrast agents may limit the use of diagnostic imaging, thus impacting treatment choices; the risks of contrast agents may limit the use of imaging. In addition, astrain pattern may mask diagnostic ST depression, and acutecoronary syndrome is less likely to present with classicalischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic changes than inthe general population, instead often manifesting as heartfailure symptoms or syncope. 659,660In people with GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR categories G3a \u2013G5), KDIGO has previously recommended that serum concentrations oftroponin be interpreted with caution with respect to diagnosisof acute coronary syndrome. 1More sensitive troponin assays maintain high diagnostic accuracy in people with CKD, buthigher assay-speci \ufb01c optimal cutoff levels may be considered. 661Regardless of assay, careful attention to trends in troponin concentration over time is required through serialmeasurement. 662 Management. In people with CKD, the same principles should be used to manage atherosclerotic risk as in peoplewithout CKD. The level of care for CVD offered to peoplewith CKD should not be prejudiced by their GFR. Datasuggest the underuse of proven effective treatment inpeople with CKD presenting with acute coronarysyndrome. 663 Prevention of ASCVD should consider pharmaceutical, dietary, and lifestyle intervention, which target traditionalcardiovascular risk factors (e.g., BP and dyslipidemias), aswell as CKD-MBD, which accelerates vascular calci \ufb01cation resulting in both vascular intima (resulting in increasedamounts of calcium in atherosclerotic plaques 664) and vascular media calci \ufb01cation (leading to increased vascular stiffness).604 3.15.1 Lipid management Dyslipidemia in CKD is frequently characterized by high tri-glycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and an increased proportion of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are small and oxidized. 665In adults with newly identi \ufb01ed CKD, it has been recommended to evaluate their lipid pro \ufb01le (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), butfollow-up lipid measurements are not required for themajority of people (i.e., a \ufb01re-and-forget policy is recommended). 19This is because treatment initiation is based on risk, and the bene \ufb01ts of statin-based therapy have been shown to be independent of the level of cholesterol. Forthose with a total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dl) and a personal or family history of premature ischemic heartdisease (e.g., an event before the age of 60 years in anindividual or \ufb01rst-degree relative), it is important to consider familial disease and specialist referral. 666 The bene \ufb01ts of lowering LDL cholesterol using statin- based therapies on the risk of ASCVD are well established in people with and without CKD. There are clearrecommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline", "for Lipid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .19The Work Group concurs with all the recommendations in this guideline. In particular, we draw attention to: Recommendation 3.15.1.1: In adults aged \u202150 years with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a \u2013G5), we recommend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A). Recommendation 3.15.1.2: In adults aged \u202150 years with CKD and eGFR \u202160 ml/min per 1.73 m2(GFR categories G1\u2013 G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B). Recommendation 3.15.1.3: In adults aged 18 \u201349 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kid- ney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment inpeople with one or more of the following (2A): /C15known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), /C15diabetes mellitus, /C15prior ischemic stroke, or /C15estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death ornonfatal myocardial infarction >10%. The Work Group offers the following practice points to support implementation of the recommendations above. Practice Point 3.15.1.1 Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool. Details of the Work Group recommendations on how to estimate risk are provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.C u r r e n t l y , the CKD patch for the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation(SCORE) tool and the American Heart Association PREVENT /C212 ,pendingequations are the only ones validated. Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin- based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largesttreatment bene \ufb01ts. Since 2013, published literature has continued to demon- strate the general safety of statin-based therapies. 667This includes individual participant-level data meta-analysis by theCholesterol Treatment Trialists \u2019collaboration, showing that statin therapy causes only a small excess of mild muscle pain,and most (> 90%) of all reports of muscle symptoms among users are not due to their statins. 668In CKD, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) demonstrated that anintensive statin-based regimen was safe and not associatedwith any serious nonvascular hazard. 669,670A Cholesterol Treatment Trialists \u2019collaboration meta-analysis combining SHARP with the other large trials took into account thesmaller reductions in LDL cholesterol achieved with statin-based therapy in people with CKD G3 \u2013G5.

There", "is good evidence for the safety of intensive LDL-cholesterol lowering, and statin-based therapycombined with a \ufb01re-and-forget strategy is low cost. This approach is consistent with a more recent recommendation for primary prevention in CKD by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (which recom-mended 10-year thresholds of >7.5%). 674 Practice Point 3.15.1.4: Consider prescribing proproteinconvertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors topeople with CKD who have an indication for their use. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) in- hibitors have been shown to safely reduce ASCVD risk whenadded to maximal tolerated statin-based regimens in people athigh coronary risk. 675,676Subgroup analyses suggest that their safety pro \ufb01le and their biochemical and clinical ef \ufb01cacy are similar when participants with CKD and without CKD arecompared. These trials recruited down to an eGFR of 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.677,678Current examples of recommendations for the use of PCSK-9 inhibitors from the cardiology community (and licensed indications) include as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment ofadults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or forpeople with clinical ASCVD who require additional lowering ofLDL cholesterol. 679,680 Dietary approaches. Practice Point 3.15.1.5: Consider a plant-based \u201cMediter- ranean-style \u201ddiet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. Diet and lipids have been comprehensively reviewed by other clinical practice guidelines.679,681In that work, the Work Groups highlighted that in general populations,observational studies have associated plant-based diets thatinclude higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, nuts,legumes, \ufb01sh, olive oil, yogurt, and whole grains, with lower risk of CVD. Diets associated with higher risk are thoseincluding high consumption of red and processed meats, re\ufb01ned carbohydrates, and salt. Vegetable sources of fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., in nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil) are also associated with a lower riskcompared with animal fats, including dairy fat. 679A Mediterranean-style diet has an emphasis on extra virginolive oil and is high in unsaturated fat. RCTs have shownthat such diets have important effects on cardiovascular riskin the long term despite only small effects on traditional markers of metabolic syndrome pro \ufb01le. 682\u2013685In the large Prevenci\u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr\u00e1nea (PREDIMED) primary prevention trial of 7447 adults, the Mediterranean diet richin extra virgin olive oil reduced the risk of majorcardiovascular events by 31% (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53 \u2013 0.91). The Coronary Diet Intervention With Olive Oil andCardiovascular Prevention (CORDIOPREV) trial found thatallocation to a Mediterranean diet rich in extra virgin olive oil reduced the risk of the composite of MACE byapproximately 22% \u201325%. 684There is no large-scale CKD- speci\ufb01c trial comparing these dietary interventions. 3.15.2 Use of antiplatelet therapy Recommendation 3.15.2.1: We recommend oral low- dose aspirin for prevention of recurrent ischemiccardiovascular disease events (i.e., secondary pre-vention) in people with CKD and established ischemic cardiovascular disease (1C). This recommendation places high value on the importance of reducing recurrence of myocardial infarction, ischemic strokes, or peripheral arterial diseas e complications in people with CKD and established ischemic CVD due to the mortality and disability associated with such complications. In secondaryprevention, trials have clearly shown the", "absolute bene \ufb01ts of low-dose aspirin substantially exceed the potential for bleedingcomplications, creating certainty about net bene \ufb01ts when treating this population. In people with CKD without priorischemic CVD, the balance of bene \ufb01ts and risks are uncertain and may be counterbalanced \u2014large RCTs are ongoing. Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harm. Based on a number of large RCTs in populations that are likely to be largely free fromCKD, lifelong use of low-dose aspirin (75 \u2013100 mg) for the prevention of recurrence of complications of ischemic CVD isstrongly recommended among people with known CVD (a therapeutic approach referred to as secondary prevention). Conversely, it is not possible to provide de \ufb01nitive recom- mendations on when to use aspirin to prevent a \ufb01rst ischemic cardiovascular event (i.e., primary prevention) in people athigh risk, and a research recommendation is provided. This isdue to uncertainty of the net absolute value of such anapproach, as any reduction in the risk of atheroscleroticcardiovascular events needs to be weighed against the risk of major bleeding. It is important to consider CKD-speci \ufb01c data in the totality of the evidence. Key evidence from general populations is derived from a 2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-thrombotic Treatment Tria- lists\u2019collaboration. The analyses included data on long-term aspirin use versus control care in 16 secondary preventiontrials (approximately 17,000 people at high average risk,approximately 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events [de \ufb01ned as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardio- vascular death]), and 6 primary prevention trials (approxi- mately 95,000 participants at low average risk, approximately660,000 person-years, 3554 serious vascular events). 685aIn the secondary prevention trials, allocation to aspirin reduced therisk of both ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction byabout one-\ufb01fth, such that an overall RR reduction for anyserious vascular event was 19% compared with controls (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75 \u20130.87). This equated to a 1.49%chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S236 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 lower absolute risk of serious vascular events per year compared with an estimated absolute risk of any majorbleeding, which was an order of magnitude smaller at0.03% per year. Note that this hazard of major bleeding was extrapolated from the primary prevention trials as stroke causes and extracranial bleeds were generally not wellrecorded in the relatively older secondary prevention trials(Figure 38 685a).Some people with CKD have been included in antiplatelet therapy trials. A recent Cochrane collaboration meta-analysisof 40,597 trial participants with CKD recruited into anti-platelet versus placebo trials and 11,805 recruited into anti- platelet agent comparison trials found that allocation to antiplatelet therapy may reduce the RR of myocardialinfarction by approximately 12% (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79 \u2013 0.99).

The 2009 meta-analysis by the Anti- thrombotic Treatment Trialists \u2019collaboration on the effect of aspirin compared with placebo in terms of the primary and secondary prevention of CVD and safety among people with and without CKD was assessed to have high risk of bias usingthe Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews(ROBIS) checklist due to unclear identi \ufb01cation and selection of studies, unclear data collection and study appraisal, andhigh risk of bias for synthesis and \ufb01ndings (although we did not contact the authors to clarify these details). 685aThis review did not report on the evidence or certainty of evidence assessments directly in the report. Given the available evidence, the recommendation has a low certaintyof evidence (Level C). Values and preferences. Maintaining QoL by minimizing risk of worsening of ischemic heart disease and recurrentstroke-related disability is important to both people withCKD and caregivers. 691The Work Group considered that the risk of bleeding would be considered acceptable by most people with CKD once the clear net bene \ufb01ts were explained and gastroprotection was offered. The Work Group considered that some people with CKD without priorischemic coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterialdisease but at increased risk (e.g., due to diabetes) may stillwish to consider using aspirin and accept the risk of majorbleeding. 687Some people with CKD may also have a kidney diagnosis that indirectly supports considering the use of aspirin despite a lack of evidence (e.g., presumed or proven renovascular disease). The Work Group is not aware of anyrisk tools that could be used to help counsel such peoplewith CKD as to their expected net absolute bene \ufb01ts and risks based on risk factors of the person with CKD,including any difference by", "sex. (Note that scores to predictcardiovascular risk are considered in Chapter 2 .) Resource use and costs. Low-dose aspirin is available at low cost and does not require monitoring. Considerations for implementation. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally effective,692safe, and low cost (althoughoccasionally associated with an interstitial nephritis), andthe Work Group considers that it is prudent to considerbleeding risk and offers PPIs when prescribing antiplatelettherapy or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such therapies are combined. 693 Rationale Meta-analysis of trials has clearly established the cardio- vascular bene \ufb01ts of low-dose aspirin in people who have established ASCVD. Any harm of bleeding is far outweighed by the bene \ufb01ts (unlike the situation for primary prevention, where bleeding risk has been consistently identi \ufb01ed in large aspirin trials and cardiovascular bene \ufb01ts to date have not). Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance. Bleeding from gastrointestinal mucosa with antiplatelet therapy is likely to be due to their effect on hemostasis of pre-existing mucosal lesions. This hypothesis is supported byP2Y 12inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel or ticagrelor) not reducing the risk of bleeding in trials comparing them to aspirin.694,695 However, if people are aspirin intolerant, a P2Y 12inhibitor is a noninferior alternative. Note that in 2009, the FDArecommended that the coadministration of clopidogrel andomeprazole (a PPI) should be avoided because omeprazole reduces the effectiveness of clopidogrel. There is uncertainty about the precise effect of omeprazole as pharmacokineticdata are inconclusive, but PPIs with inhibition of CYP2C19are preferred when using clopidogrel. 696 Guidelines from the cardiology community provide rec- ommendations for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy for aperiod after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneouscoronary intervention. These guidelines recommend to apply the same diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in people with CKD. 663CKD does not modify the bene \ufb01ts of ticagrelor,697and antiplatelet therapy doses do not need to be modi\ufb01 ed at decreased eGFR. Note that other antithrombotic therapy choices and doses may need toconsider a person \u2019sG F R . Special considerations International considerations. Given the clinical effectiveness of low-dose aspirin and its low cost, there should not be manybarriers to accessing this medication in any setting. 3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary artery disease Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable stress-test con \ufb01rmed ischemic heart disease, an initial conservative approach using intensive medi- cal therapy is an appropriate alternative to an initial invasive strategy (2D).chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S238 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 This recommendation places high value on the \ufb01nding from recent, large trials in both general and CKD populations that have suggested that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initialstrategy for the management of stable stress-test con \ufb01rmed ischemic heart disease. It places value on the need for in-terventions, which carry risk to people with CKD and sub-stantial healthcare costs to demonstrate bene \ufb01ts on cardiovascular outcomes before they are considered a standard ofcare. Importantly, this recommendation should not apply tothose with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction(e.g., ejection fraction <35%), or left", "main stem disease as they were excluded from the de \ufb01nitive trials. It should be noted that trials in CKD have not ruled out antianginal bene \ufb01ts in people with CKD (despite negative \ufb01ndings). Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harm. Bene \ufb01ts.Bene\ufb01ts should be considered in the context of the totality of evidence in people with and without CKD regarding interventions. Comparisons between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive in-terventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce deathor prevent myocardial infarction. 707,707aHowever, those with frequent angina symptoms (at least weekly) gainedimprovement with the invasive strategy 707; thus, the bene \ufb01t of an invasive strategy might be restricted to those withangina. The reason for a lack of clear antianginal effect of an invasive strategy in International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches \u2014 Chronic Kidney Disease (ISCHEMIA-CKD) needs someconsideration, and key reasons relating to insuf \ufb01cient power due to protocol differences have been proposed. 698Although low power to detect an effect on angina is a key potentialexplanation for differences in \ufb01ndings between the 2 trials, CKD-MBD and coronary calci \ufb01cation in CKD, which makes microvascular disease more common and increases thetechnical challenge of revascularization, may also have partlycontributed to these differences. 699 The ERT assessed the effects of angiography or coronary intervention in people with CKD and ischemic heart diseaseidenti \ufb01ed 4 other trials, but excluded mixed populations, including ISCHEMIA-CKD, which recruited some people ondialysis and some people who have received a kidney trans- plant. The review found no clear bene \ufb01ts on cardiovascular outcomes in 3 other trials and raised a hypothesis about bene\ufb01cial effects on mortality overall (Supplementary Table S13 700\u2013704). Such an effect has not been observed in the larger general population trials. Harms. The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was inter-estingly not periprocedural). 707 Certainty of evidence. The ERT review was limited to trials only recruiting people with CKD (and did not include theISCHEMIA-CKD trial discussed above due to the inclusion ofsome people on dialysis and some people who have received akidney transplant). The overall certainty of the evidencecomparing coronary revascularization with optimal medicaltherapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT andischemic heart disease is very low (Supplementary TableS13 700\u2013704). Most of the RCTs reporting on the critical outcomes (all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, kidney failure, and AKI) had some concerns regarding the risk of bias, particularly with lack of blinding for theoutcome assessors, participants crossing over to the othertreatment group, and the selection of reporting. Thecertainty of the evidence was downgraded for all outcomesbecause of imprecision. The certainty of the evidence forcardiovascular mortality was downgraded becausepublication bias was strongly suspected. Values and preferences. Although this was not con \ufb01rmed by ISCHEMIA-CKD, antianginal bene \ufb01ts of an invasive strategy are apparent in general populations, and people withsymptoms may still elect for an initially invasive approach tomanage stable stress-test con \ufb01rmed coronary artery disease after being counseled about the risks. Resource", "use and costs. It is not possible to formally assess the cost-effectiveness of intensive medical therapy versus an initial invasive strategy due to mixed \ufb01ndings from the evi- dence in people with stable ischemic heart disease. However, invasive strategies will have higher cost implications tohealthcare systems, people with CKD, or both. Considerations for implementation. Access and availability of invasive therapies will vary in different healthcare sys-tems, as might the availability of medications for maximalmedical therapy. The key to implementation is to encourage the understanding of the value of full therapy as compared with invasive therapy so that healthcare providers andpeople with CKD understand the risks and bene \ufb01ts of invasive strategies. Given the costs of invasive strategies,there may be additional value to implementing thisrecommendation. Rationale Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasivestrategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based onsymptoms, and intensive medical therapy is a suitable approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or without CKD. In CKD, the antianginal bene \ufb01ts of an initially invasive approach have not been demonstrated. Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an inva- sive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKDwith acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levelsof angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left ventricular systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease. The ISCHEMIA trial has been described as deeply dis- rupting prior attitudes regarding management strategies forpeople with stable coronary artery disease, 705and clinical practice guidelines that predate the trial need updating.706 Despite the International Study of Comparative HealthEffectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) and ISCHEMIA-CKD trial results, it iswww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S239 considered that the well-established intervention of coronary revascularization will continue to have a key role in anginarelief. 705Importantly, this recommendation should not apply to those with unacceptably severe angina symptoms. It should also be noted that people with left ventricular dysfunction (i.e., ejection fraction <35%) or left main disease were excluded from the de \ufb01nitive ISCHEMIA trial.707aThe Work Group considers that certain design features of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial may have led toangina bene \ufb01ts not being detected, and the trial results should not rule out angina bene \ufb01ts in people with CKD (see above). If an invasive strategy is pursued, there are effective strategies to reduce the risk of contrast-induced AKI (Chapter 4). 708 The totality of the evidence from the CKD-speci \ufb01c trials is consistent with no net difference between an initial conser-vative approach using aggressive medical therapy versus aninvasive strategy when treating stable stress-test con \ufb01rmed ischemic heart disease. This is consistent with the large gen-eral population-based ISCHEMIA trial. 707a 3.16 CKD and atrial \ufb01brillation In CKD, the same principles to diagnose and manage atrial \ufb01brillation should be used as in people without CKD. Prevalence and consequences. Atrial \ufb01brillation is the com- monest sustained arrhythmia, with risk increasing steeply with increasing age (earlier in men than women).709There is a particularly high prevalence in people with CKD. Crudeprevalence ranging from 16%", "to 21% has been reported inpeople with CKD not requiring KRT. 710In the cohorts contributing to the CKD-PC, adults with CKD G3, A1 had an adjusted risk of atrial \ufb01brillation of 1.2 \u20131.5, increasing to an adjusted risk of 4.2 by CKD stages G5, A3 ( Figure 3912). Atrial \ufb01brillation can directly cause thromboembolism (particularly stroke) and/or heart failure. It is also linked, perhaps directly or through shared risk factors, with increasedrisk of death, hospitalization, vascular dementia, depression,and reduced QoL. 709Detailed clinical practice guidelines have been formulated by the cardiology community describing de\ufb01nitions, classi \ufb01cation, diagnosis, screening strategies, and management.709It is beyond the scope of this KDIGO guideline to consider all aspects of the diagnosis and management of atrial \ufb01brillation in people with CKD. The ERT review focused on the role of non \u2013vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus warfarin forthromboprophylaxis in CKD. Identi \ufb01cation and management. Atrial \ufb01brillation can be asymptomatic but symptoms are not a prerequisite for risk ofcomplications. As the prevalence of atrial \ufb01brillation is high in people with CKD and there are effective strategies to manageits associated complications, opportunistic pulse-basedscreening (e.g., when taking BP), followed by a 12-leadelectrocardiogram if an irregularly irregular pulse is identi \ufb01ed should be considered. Such an approach is low cost andsimple to implement. Figure 40 outlines approaches to different diagnostic and management strategies. Practice Point 3.16.1: Follow established strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial \ufb01brillation ( Figure 40 ). Prophylaxis against stroke and systemic thromboembolism. Recent cardiology guidelines recommend a risk factor \u2013based approach to stroke thromboprophylaxis decisions in atrial\ufb01brillation using the Congestive heart failure, Hypertension,Age$75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74, and Sex category (female) (CHA 2DS2- VASc) stroke risk score. They recommend that only people at\u201clow stroke risk \u201d(CHA 2DS2-VASc score \u00bc0i nm e n ,o r1i n women) should not be offered antithrombotic therapy. Oralanticoagulants should be considered for stroke preventionwith a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women, considering net clinical bene \ufb01t and values and preferences of people with CKD. Oral anticoagulants are clearly recom-mended for stroke prevention in people with atrial \ufb01brillation and a CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2 in men or $3 in women.709 Our Work Group considered that oral anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis should nearly always be considered for preventing stroke in people with decreased eGFR and atrial\ufb01brillation (Figure 40 ). The presence of decreased GFR is a risk for thromboembolic stroke in people with atrial\ufb01brillation. 710\u2013712It has been estimated that approximately 95% of people with an eGFR of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 have a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of $2, increasing to approximately 99% at an eGFR of <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.711Importantly, it has also been shown that in a group of people with a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 0 to 1 point (i.e., a group where thromboprophylaxis may not be consideredindicated), people with CKD within the group are at muchhigher risk of cerebrovascular and other systemic105+ 90\u2013104 60\u201389 45\u201359 30\u201344 15\u201329", "<15<10 10\u201329 30\u2013299 300\u2013999 1000+ 1.1 1.3 1.7 2.4 3.5 Ref 1.2 1.5 1.9 2.3 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.7 2.21.2 1.3 1.5 1.8 2.4 1.4 1.5 1.7 2.0 2.4 1.9 1.8 2.0 2.6 3.02.6 2.5 3.1 3.6 4.2Overall eGFRcrACR (mg/g) Atrial fibrillation: 50 cohorts Study size = 22,886,642; events = 1,068,701 Figure 39 | Meta-analyzed adjusted prevalence of atrial \ufb01brillation from cohorts contributing to the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, by diabetes status.

There isconsiderable scope to improve the predictive performanceof thromboprophylaxis risk scores for use in CKD. 713 Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of non\u2013vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in preference to vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,warfarin) for thromboprophylaxis in atrial \ufb01brilla- tion in people with CKD G1\u2013 G4(1C). This recommendation puts high value on the use of NOACs, also referred to as direct-acting oral anticoagulants or DOACs, in people with CKD due to their simpler pharmacokinetic pro \ufb01le, dosing, and monitoring than vitamin K antagonists and due to their improved ef \ufb01cacy and relatively similar safety pro \ufb01le. Although people with CKD G4 \u2013G5 have been understudied in RCTs, implementation in such groups can be achieved afterconsidering choice of NOAC and dosing.Key information Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. Bene\ufb01 ts.Data from 42,411 participants who received NOACs and 29,272 participantswho received warfarin in 4 phase III trials were meta-analyzedin 2014. Such trials largely excluded people with CKD G4 \u2013G5 but did include large numbers of participants with earlierstages of CKD. Overall, NOACs signi \ufb01cantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared withwarfarin (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73 \u20130.91). This bene \ufb01t was a result largely from reduced risk of hemorrhagic strokes (RR:0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 \u20130.64). There were large amounts of data on stroke in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min, and the relative bene \ufb01ts were consistent and clearly evident in people with CKD. There were also consistent effects in subgroupanalyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, and CHADS 2 score.714A more recent meta-analysis published in", "2021 only focused on subgroups with CKD and included data from 7 trials of NOACs versus warfarin in atrial \ufb01brillation. It also reported a 19% reduced risk of stroke/thromboembolic complications in the NOAC group (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.69\u20130.97). 715Data in CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to observational studies.715Our evidence review aimed to collect information on subtypes of outcome from subgroupanalyses reporting results speci \ufb01cally in people with CKD. Evidence of ef \ufb01cacy in the large trials is mainly for the outcomes of stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, but our reviewonly found data from 3 trials for these outcomes resultingin imprecise estimates of effect. The \ufb01ndings were qualitatively consistent with the totality of the evidence(Figure 41 ,Supplementary Table S14 716\u2013721). Step 1 Diagnosis\u2022 In people with CKD, use opportunistic pulse-based screening (e.g., taking at when measuring BP), followed by a wearable device or Holter ECG testing Step 2 Prophylaxis against stroke and systemic thromboembolism (they are likely to have an increased CHA2DS2-VASc risk factor for stroke and are at high risk even with a score of 0\u20131) managed (e.g., alcohol advice, use of a proton pump inhibitor) Step 3 Rate/rhythm control\u2020 \u2022 Use medical therapy (e.g., beta blockade) to control ventricular rate to less than about 90 bpm at rest to decrease symptoms and related complications \u2022 For people with persistent symptoms despite adequate rate control, consider rhythm control with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic therapy and/or catheter ablation Figure 40 | Strategies for the diagnosis and management of atrial \ufb01brillation. * Consider dose adjustments necessary in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\u2020The following has been recommended as a standard package for diagnostic evaluation of new atrial \ufb01brillation: (i) a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to establish the diagnosis, assess ventricular rate, and check for the presence of conduction defects, ischemia, or structural heart disease; (ii) laboratory testing for thyroid and kidney function, serum electrolytes, and full blood count; and (iii)transthoracic echocardiography to assess left ventricular size and function, left atrial size, for valvular disease, and right heart size and function.BP, blood pressure; CHA 2DS2-VASc, Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age $75 (doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (doubled), Vascular disease, Age 65 to 74, and Sex category (female); HAS-BLED, Hypertension, Abnormal liver/kidney function, Stroke history, Bleeding history orpredisposition, Labile international normalized ratio (INR), Elderly, Drug/alcohol usage.www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S241 Harms. The 2014 meta-analysis of 4 large phase III trials found that NOACs reduced the risk of death from any cause by 10%, con \ufb01rming net safety (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85\u20130.95). Compared with warfarin, NOACs reduced the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (de \ufb01ned as hemorrhagic stroke, epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage)by about one-half (RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.39 \u20130.59), and the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was increased by aboutone-quarter (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.01 \u20131.55). Overall, there was no clear effect on the combination of these 2 safetyoutcomes referred to as major bleeding (RR: 0.86; 95% CI:0.73\u20131.00). 714There were large amounts of data on major bleeding in those with a CrCl of", "<50 ml/min, so reassuring safety data clearly extended to people withCKD. There were also consistent safety data in subgroupanalyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, andCHADS 2score. There was a suggestion that major bleeding was signi \ufb01cantly reduced in people attending centers where time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) rangewas<66% compared with centers with $66% time in range (interaction P\u00bc0.02). This suggests that bene \ufb01ts of NOACs are in part a result of their simpler pharmacokinetic pro \ufb01leand dosing. 714The 2021 meta-analysis that focused on CKD subgroups from 7 trials found that bleeding events were alsonot signi \ufb01cantly different among those allocated NOACs versus warfarin (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.58 \u20131.18). 715Data in CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to observational studies.715 Our evidence review was again limited to a small number of studies reporting subtypes of bleeding outcomes, and so analyses found imprecise estimates of treatment effect. The\ufb01ndings were qualitatively consistent with the totality of the evidence ( Figure 42 ,Supplementary Table S15 716\u2013722). The review raised a hypothesis that some NOACs may be morelikely to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, given theevidence of effect modi \ufb01cation by time in therapeutic range in the warfarin group, we have not provided speci \ufb01c recommendations to prefer certain NOACs. Certainty of evidence. The overall certainty of the evidence comparing NOACs with warfarin among people with CKDand atrial \ufb01brillation is low (Supplementary Tables S14 716\u2013721 and S15716\u2013722). Most of the RCTs evaluating the critical outcomes were considered to have a low risk of bias. Thecritical outcome of stroke was reported as any stroke,ischemic stroke, and/or hemorrhagic stroke.

Values and preferences. High value on the use of NOACs included the conclusion that the simple dosing and lack ofINR monitoring compared with vitamin K antagonists wouldlead to a substantial reduction in burden for those with an indication for anticoagulation and their health services. There is also good evidence for improved ef \ufb01cacy and a relatively similar safety pro \ufb01le. Most fully informed people with CKD would be expected to select a NOAC over a vitamin Kantagonist. Resource use and costs. NOACs have been shown to be cost-effective for stroke prevention in atrial \ufb01brillation and may even be cost-saving in people with CKD. Vitamin K antagonist use may be associated with higher costs andachieve fewer quality-adjusted life-years compared with NOACs.723 Considerations for implementation. A decision not to anti- coagulate for thromboembolic prophylaxis due to low riskwould ideally be re-evaluated at each consultation and at leastevery 6 months. When using antithrombotic therapy in people with CKD, it is prudent to treat modi \ufb01able risk factors for bleeding (e.g., alcohol intake) and use gastroprophylaxis with a PPI, particularly when combined with antiplatelettherapy.

Medications can be highly bene \ufb01- cial, but some may be toxic, are excreted by the kidney, mayhave narrow therapeutic windows, or may have no provenclear evidence of bene \ufb01t or indication in people with CKD. Drug stewardship refers to the effective, safe, and sus- tainable use of medications by all staff and physicians,encompassing the whole cycle of medication use. Medica- tions need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for ef \ufb01- cacy and safety, and when they do not or no longer serve their intended purpose, discontinued. This chapter discusseskey concepts in the processes of drug stewardship in peoplewith CKD. It is beyond the scope of this guideline to list allthe medications that may have altered risks/bene \ufb01ts in people with CKD. Such information is widely available indocuments that may exist at local, regional, or national bodies (e.g., British National Formulary: www.bnf.org )a n d in textbooks of pharmacology. However, we describe case examples to highlight the key classes of commonly pre-scribed medications in people with CKD. This guidance isbased on knowledge of pharmacology that has universalrelevance. In many cases, knowledge of altered risks/bene \ufb01ts of medications comes, however, from observational studiesand case reports from routine care. 4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety Abnormal kidney function results in alteration in pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and for people with CKD, as the GFR worsens, so does the prevalence of polypharmacyand comorbidities. 725People with CKD are at increased risk of medication errors and inappropriate prescribing (notedto be up to 37% in ambulatory outpatient studies and upto 43% in long-term care studies 726,727). Thus, improved understanding and collaboration with pharmacists indeveloping care plans and medication review is strongly recommended. People with CKD have reduced ability to excrete medica- tions and/or their metabolites (which may increase adverse event risk or exaggerate/diminish ef \ufb01cacy) and increased sensitivity to medications (e.g., those bound to albumin inhypoalbuminemic states such as nephrotic syndrome).Additional issues include nephrotoxicity, diminished toler-ance of side effects in the context of coexisting comorbidities or older age, and lack of adequate evidence for either bene \ufb01t or harm of speci \ufb01c compounds, due to historical exclusion of people with (advanced) CKD from most clinical trials. 727,728As in all medical decision-making, healthcare providers should consider the indication, bene \ufb01t-risk pro \ufb01le, and po- tential nephrotoxicity while balancing accessibility, availabil- ity, local health policies, cultural practices, affordability, andpatient preferences. Where available, consultation withpharmacists as part of the multidisciplinary team is encour-aged to assure optimized comprehensive medication man-agement and to improve pharmacoequity. Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more sus- ceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. Whenprescribing such medications to people with CKD, alwaysconsider the bene \ufb01ts versus potential harms. Between 18% \u201320% of people with CKD G3 \u2013G5 receive", "at least one potentially inappropriate nephrotoxic medicationannually, primarily NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antivirals, and bisphosphonates. 729Nephrotoxic medications may be indicated in people with CKD if expected bene \ufb01ts exceed potential harms.730However, whenever possible, healthcare providers should strive to use non-nephrotoxic alternatives. Common nephrotoxic medications to be aware of andpotential alternatives that could be prescribed instead arelisted in Table 31 . 725,731\u2013738Although some nephrotoxic medications have viable alternatives, the alternatives may be less potent or there is limited comparison data on clinical outcomes, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and ther- apeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people withCKD receiving medications with narrow therapeutic win-dows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity, both inoutpatient practice and in hospital settings. Ensuring a safe use of medication requires careful moni- toring for adverse effects and ef \ufb01cacy. A key example includes the need to monitor potassium and creatinine during theinitial weeks of treatment with ACEi and ARBs (Figure 21 ). 23 Medications such as gentamicin and vancomycin have anarrow therapeutic range, with higher trough levelscommonly associated with AKI, and so require closemonitoring of GFR and medication levels during prolonged treatment. 731Other medications, such as lithium or methotrexate, require at least annual monitoring of creatinine to evaluate potential risks of nephrotoxicity. Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the- counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that maybe harmful for people with CKD.chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S246 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Kidney disease can be induced or accelerated by the use of certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal rem- edies, and other dietary supplements. One of the most usedclass of OTC analgesic medications is NSAIDs. NSAIDs areassociated with interstitial nephritis, analgesic nephropathy,and hypertension. 739Indiscriminate chronic OTC NSAID use has been associated with a higher risks of kidney failure compared with nonuse and should be discouraged.740\u2013743 However, judicious NSAID use, under careful supervision of a nephrologist, may be preferred to other pain medicationssuch as opioids that have stronger associations with adverseevents. 744,745PPIs are also common OTC medications in some countries that have been associated with AKI andCKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute interstitialnephritis. 733,734 The use of herbal compounds remains highly prevalent in some countries and cultures.746These products are often used in an unmonitored setting without the input of healthcareproviders. Many of these remedies are composed of naturalcompounds with complex active ingredients that have notbeen evaluated in people with CKD and/or that may lead tomany different adverse effects. The frequency of CKDassociated with herbal remedy use is not known and is likely different in different parts of the world, depending on local availability and reasons for use. Examples includearistolochic acid nephropathy or nephrotoxicity due toalkaloid compounds often found in Chinese herbalremedies. 747However, cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported for many other herbal remedies globally.746,748,749 The potential toxicity of herbal remedies may be enhancedby coexisting volume depletion and by other illness ormedication use. Dietary supplements are readily available in most countries around the world and are usually not classi \ufb01ed as OTC med-", "ications. Because of this, their regulation for identity and safetycan vary widely. Although laws pertaining to dietary supple-ment labeling prohibit speci \ufb01c claims for the treatment or prevention of disease, these products are widely used as\u201calternative \u201dor\u201ccomplementary \u201dtherapy. Patients and pro- viders often assume that these products are at least safe andpossibly effective. Their pharmacokinetics may be unknownand potential toxicity unstudied. Classic examples includecreatine supplements used for body building that have beenassociated with allergic interstitial nephritis. 750,751Another example is vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements, which in excess can lead to tubular calcium oxalate crystal deposition.752 Healthcare providers are encouraged to routinely inquire about the use of herbal remedies and recommend stopping any unprescribed alternative remedy that may pose a threatfor (kidney) health. Figure 45 747,753,754lists common herbal remedies and dietary supplements arranged by the countrieswhere the adverse effects were reported to increaseawareness and facilitate discussions. Special considerations Global access to medications. Access to medications varies globally. Approximately 30% of the world population lackstimely access to quality medications. The International Soci- ety of Nephrology (ISN) reports that only 35% of patients in low-resource settings have access to ACEi/ARBs, statins, andTable 31 | Key examples of common medications with documented nephrotoxicity and, where available, selected non- nephrotoxic alternatives Nephrotoxic medication Potential non-nephrotoxic alternatives Analgesics NSAIDs: nephrotoxic effects include a decrease in GFR through a reduction in prostaglandin-dependent kidney blood \ufb02ow, allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN), and nephrotic syndrome725Acetaminophen AntimicrobialsAminoglycosides: accumulates in the proximal tubular cells and disrupts phospholipid metabolism, resulting in cell apoptosis and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) 731,732Cephalosporins and carbapenems Vancomycin: unclear cause of nephrotoxicity, but likely related to ATN and possible AIN731,732Linezolid and daptomycin731 Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim: AIN, ATN, crystalluria within the distal convoluted tubule and reversible inhibition of tubular creatinine secretion731Clindamycin \u00feprimaquine, pentamidine, and atovaquone Gastrointestinal medicationsProton pump inhibitors: may result in AKI and CKD due to tubulointerstitial nephritis and AIN 733,734H2-receptor antagonists Cardiovascular medicationsWarfarin: glomerular hemorrhage, oxidative stress causing kidney tubular damage, and direct effects on kidney vascular calci \ufb01cation by vitamin K\u2013 dependent alterations of matrix Gla protein 735,736Non\u2013vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants OtherLithium: nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as well as CKD from chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy 737Aripiprazole, lamotrigine, quetiapine, valproate CKD, chronic kidney disease; GFR, glomerular \ufb01ltration rate; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-in \ufb02ammatory drug.www.kidney-international.org chapter 4 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S247 insulin.755There are also numerous barriers to additional important medications for the management of CKD complications, such as erythropoietin analogs, iron infusion,and phosphate or potassium binders. There are growing concerns regarding the use of falsi \ufb01ed and substandard medications in low- to lower-middle \u2013in- come countries as they pose potential harm, particularly tothose people at risk of and with CKD. Patients and theirfamilies should be aware that medication falsi\ufb01 cation is often associated with illicit internet supply. Many vulnerable com-munities and people with low health literacy and those incountries with less rigorous regulatory systems are more atrisk of medication falsi \ufb01cation. Therefore, increased global awareness is important, and people with CKD should beprovided with appropriate education and follow-up withrelevant", "support in accordance with local health policies. Medications and pregnancy. Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications topeople with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, alwaysreview teratogenicity potential and provide regular repro-ductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance with the values and preferences of the person with CKD. When pregnancy is not desired, we note that while the effect of different forms of contraception on GFR is un- known, 756oral contraceptives are associated with increasedBP and hypertension.757Nonoral hormonal contraceptives have a less clear impact on BP.757 Pregnancy may pose a risk of CKD progression for people with established CKD. In addition, some recommended medi-cations to slow or prevent CKD progression are teratogenic (such as ACEi/ARBs or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) and discontinuation during pregnancy should be considered. 758 Some CKD-speci \ufb01c medications should be continued during pregnancies such as hydroxychloroquine, tacrolimus,cyclosporin, eculizumab, prednisone, azathioprine, colchicine,and intravenous immunoglobulin. A thorough medicationchart review is necessary to replace teratogenic medicationsbefore conception, or whenever this is not possible, ensure a strict monitoring plan with cessation of potentially teratogenic medications at conception. 759A similar approach should be undertaken during lactation recognizing that somemedications suitable for use during pregnancy may not beappropriate for lactation, and vice versa. 760Multidisciplinary care with obstetrics and potentially other subspecialty care isrequired before conception and throughout pregnancy andlactation. 54 Sex-speci \ufb01c aspects of medication use in CKD. Sex differences in medication safety and ef \ufb01cacy in people with CKD are understudied,38,761,762For example, sex differences in body weight and composition as well as physiological functionsTripterygium Chimonanthus Tetrandra Menispermi StrychnosWood veratry Aconitum Groundsel Monkhood Bee pollenFish gallbladderCyprinidae (grass carp, common carp, silver carp, black shark fish, bony-lipped barb fish) Indian carp (Labeo rohita ) Mourning cypress (Cupressus funebris ) Snake gallbladder ( Naja naja atra ) Star fruit ( Averrhoa carambola) Oduvan ( Cleistanthus collinus ) Yellow oleander (Thevetia peruviana ) Djenkol beans, jering (Pithecolobium lobatum ) Cone flower (Echinacea) Spurge (Euphorbia matabelensis)Khat leaf ( Catha edulis ) Cape aloe (Aloe capensis ) Impila, ox-eye daisy ( Callilepis laureola ) Potassium dichromateWild wisteria, violet tree(Securidaca longipedunculata ) Paraphenylene diamine (PPD) Takaout roumia Sheep bile Bird flower ( Crotalaria laburnifolia )Worldwide: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra ) Mushrooms (Amanita phalloides, Cortinarius spp.) Aristocholic acid-containing Chinese herbsAlfafa ( Medicago sativa L.)

Because drug dosages are often universal, women are more likely toconsume higher doses in relation to their bodyweight, 136,763,764and this could be associated with more adverse events.136In people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, observational studies show improvedsurvival in women with lower doses of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocking medications, whereasmen bene \ufb01t from higher doses. 765,766This may be related to lower RAAS activity in women compared with men.767 4.2 Dose adjustments by level of GFR Practice Point 4.2.1: Consider GFR when dosing medicationscleared by the kidneys. Many medications and/or their active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Failure to properly account for theeffect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regi-mens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverseevents. 725,728Although guidelines for adjustment of the dosing regimen at varying severities of CKD provided bythe manufacturer are widely available in pharmacopeias,textbooks, online references, or local procedures, there maybe signi \ufb01cant differences in information provided by these resources. 768 Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings,validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate fordrug dosing. Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situ- ations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use ofequations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, ormeasured GFR may be indicated. An assessment of GFR is important for guiding decisions related to the choice and dosing of medications. Section 1.2 addresses the accuracy of validated eGFR equations, as wellas indications for the use of eGFRcr-cys or mGFR. There is inconsistency between this guidance and those found in the package inserts or classic source references fordrug dosing. Regulatory agencies have not universallyrequired pharmacokinetics in abnormal kidney function formedication approval. 769In addition, although the Cockcroft- Gault formula for estimating CrCl has been used in many pastpharmacokinetic studies that serve as the basis for the drugdosing, there are multiple concerns with that equation. It was developed in an era when the need for standardization of creatinine measurements was not appreciated, womenand individuals of Black race were not included, and thereare concerns about use of weight, which can be impactedby edema or obesity. 770However, to date, few studies have been conducted to compare different equations for eGFR inthe context of drug dosing/kinetics, etc.There is now a recognition by major regulatory agencies that \u201cany contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonableto assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies. \u201d 770,771 Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of bodyweight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) maybe", "indicated, especially for medications with a narrowtherapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentrationto be effective. For assessment of CKD, it is relevant to compare the GFR according to a standard body size. For this reason, GFR estimating equations have been developed in units of ml/min per 1.73 m 2. However, because drug clearance is more strongly associated with nonindexed eGFR (ml/min) thanindexed eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m 2), in very small or large individuals, this can result in over- or underdosing, respec-tively, as well as noninitiation of certain medications. 772,773 Nonindexed eGFR can be obtained by multiplying theindexed eGFR results by the person \u2019s BSA and dividing by 1.73 m 2, or by using an appropriate online calculator. Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing inpeople where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the \ufb01ltration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state. In people with rapidly changing health status, it can be a challenge to estimate the GFR. Serum concentrations of\ufb01ltration markers may be changing because of changes in true GFR and/or in non-GFR determinants of the marker (Section 1.2). In such settings for people who require medications that are impacted by or could impact GFR, healthcare providersshould regularly assess risk, bene \ufb01ts, and value of the medication, and consider higher or lower doses thanindicated. Where possible, use medication level testing toguide dosing. 730,774 Special considerations Dose adjustments in cancer. GFR plays a large role in determining anticancer therapy, including anticancer agentselection, dosing, and eligibility for investigational drugs and clinical trials. 775,776Notwithstanding its lack of validation and its relative inaccuracy compared with other validated eGFR equations, the Cockroft-Gault equation continues to be oneof the most commonly used eGFR methods for thesepeople. 775,776An evaluation of eGFR equation performance against mGFR determined by plasma clearance of51Cr- EDTA in 1200 people with solid tumors observed theeGFRcr (CKD-EPI) and the eGFRcr-cys (CKD-EPI) predicted mGFR with greater accuracy than Cockroft- Gault. 136We advise that the same approach to GFR evaluation described in Section 1.2be adopted in oncology practice and clinical trials.136,764BSA-adjusted eGFR may be indicated for selected speci \ufb01c situations like carboplatin dosing. It is important to consider that non-GFRdeterminants of both creatinine and cystatin C may bewww.kidney-international.org chapter 4 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S249 more profound in people with cancer, and mGFR may be the preferred method to guide the initial dosing for a select groupof anticancer drugs including, but not limited to, carboplatin,cisplatin, and methotrexate (Section 1.2). Dose adjustment in children/neonates. In addition to the usual weight-based dosing for children, speci \ufb01c guidance on drug dosing should be followed for neonates who have lowerGFR than those outside the neonatal period. Dose adjustment in pregnancy. Creatinine decreases physi- ologically during pregnancy due to glomerular hyper-\ufb01ltration, and BSA varies. This creates challenges for usingGFR or eGFR equations. 54In such settings for people who require medications that are impacted by or could impactGFR, healthcare providers should regularly assess risk,bene\ufb01t, and value of medications. 4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship People with", "CKD are particularly susceptible to poly-pharmacy due to multiplicity of comorbidities and multiplephysician or health system encounters related to those. Mostpeople with CKD not treated with dialysis receive 6 \u201312 different medications per day. 763Polypharmacy leads to increased pill burden and potential harm due to medication errors and drug-drug interactions. Thus, healthcare providers, including clinical pharmacists, should be diligentin assessing medication appropriateness, number, dose, andpotential interactions. Drug stewardship promotes safemedication use throughout the course of therapy.Medications need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for ef \ufb01cacy and safety, and when no longer required, discontinued. Practice Point 4.3.1: Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence,continued indication, and potential drug interactionsbecause people with CKD often have complex medicationregimens and are seen by multiple specialists. Medication review is essential for minimizing the occur- rence of medication-related problems (e.g., inappropriatelyhigh doses and drug interactions) that commonly occur in theCKD population. 777If a person no longer has an indication for a medication that may contribute to kidney injury (e.g.,PPIs), healthcare providers should recognize theopportunity to discontinue the medication. Medicationreview at each clinical encounter, especially care transitions, is an opportunity to review medication types, interval, and doses especially if the individual has experienced a declinein GFR (e.g., metformin) or physiologic changes that canimpact medication volume of distribution (e.g., volumeoverload and sarcopenia). 778Figure 46729discusses key steps in the medication review process.

Best practices for medication review and reconciliation in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) include 8 steps728and can be summarized as follows: (i) obtain an accurate medication list from the patient; (ii) evaluate whether all medications are medically necessary or whether any other medications is required; (iii) assess whether current therapy represents the \u201cdrug of choice \u201dfor each indication, individualized for each patient; (iv) evaluate the medication dosage and regimen, taking into consideration related factors such as liver dysfunction, patient size, or weight (e.g., amputation, muscle wasting, and over- orunderweight); (v) review the medication list for drug interactions, including drug-drug, drug-disease, drug-laboratory, and drug-foodinteractions; (vi) ensure that proper monitoring takes place; (vii) determine whether there are any barriers to patient adherence, and evaluaterelevant laboratory values; and (viii) identify and resolve any discrepancies between the medications list and the one in the medical record;communication of performed changes in the medication chart with other physicians is necessary given the role of multiple prescribers involvedin the care of patients with", "CKD. 729chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S250 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 evaluated medication review by clinical practices in people with CKD, observing reductions in the use of inappropriatemedications and medication-related problems, both inoutpatient and inpatient settings. 765,766The most frequent reviews involved altering dosage or dose interval anddiscontinuing NSAIDs. More frequent medication reviewsmay be needed in older adults with complex medicationregimens compared with younger people with CKD. In the context of good drug stewardship, healthcare pro- viders should be aware of the issue of \u201cprescribing cascade. \u201dA prescribing cascade is a sequence of events that begins whenan adverse event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this adverse event. 779Before prescribing new medications to address newly reported symptoms, it is important to \ufb01rst assess if the symptoms represent a side effect from an existingmedication. An example of a prescribing cascade is asfollows: peripheral edema because of calcium channelblocker may be managed by initiation of a new medication(i.e., diuretic), which can lead to additional adverse reactions (e.g., hypokalemia and dizziness). Practice Point 4.3.2: If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a clear plan of when torestart the discontinued medications to the affected personand healthcare providers, and ensure documentation in themedical record. Sick day rules have been endorsed as useful guidance to people with CKD in the setting of acute, dehydrating illness. Speci \ufb01cally, patients receive guidance to temporarily stop the followingmedications: sulfonylureas, ACEi, diuretics/direct renin in-h i b i t o r s ,m e t f o r m i n ,A R B s ,N S A I D s ,a n dS G L T 2 i( o f t e nd e s c r i b e dwith the acronym SADMANS). 780However, there is a paucity of evidence to support sick day rules to prevent AKI or otherclinically relevant outcomes. 781,782Instead, data suggest potential harm if people make mistakes in recognizing dehydrating illness or about which drugs to stop and when to restart.783Figure 47 shows the steps that must occur correctly for sick day rules to be implemented appropriately. The mostreported problem is failure to restart the medication. 784The plan to restart medications should be detailed in the medicalrecords and clearly communicated to the patients. Patients mayadditionally bene \ufb01tf r o mm e d i c a t i o nr e v i e ww i t h i nam o n t ht o ensure appropriate medications are restarted.Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation ofmedications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i)in the 48 \u201372 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary measure to prevent complications. However, note that failure to restart these medications after the event or pro-cedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point4.3.2). The rationale for temporary discontinuation of certain medications before elective surgery or procedures is to pre-vent perioperative AKI and other complications such as hy-potension or metabolic acidosis or", "hyperkalemia during the perioperative period. 735Medications that should be discontinued before elective surgery due to potential perioperative adverse effects are shown in Table 32 .735,736 There is consistent evidence that withholding RASi is associated with lower risk of perioperative hypotension invarious types of surgery and procedures (noncardiac surgery,cardiac surgery, and coronary angiography). 737,785,786The evidence that withholding RASi would lower perioperative AKI is less consistent as affected by fewer studies with low sample sizes.787,788In the surgical context, antihyperglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas, metformin,and SGLT2i would be held because of fasting before thesurgery. Case reports, case series, and a systematic review of47 cases 739,740,789support the current recommendations that SGLT2i should be withheld at least 3 \u20134 days before the elective surgery.741,742 Temporary discontinuation of medications to manage adverse events is indicated in most cases. However, fear foradverse event recurrence often results in failure to resumetreatments. In CKD, hyperkalemia or AKI are not uncommonadverse effects of RASi treatment, to which clinical guidelinesrecommend discontinuation of RASi and therapy reinitiationat low dosages when the event is resolved. 23,29,790,791Despite this advice, permanent discontinuation of RASi seems to be the most common clinical reaction to occurrence of adverse events.580,792Observational studies consistently show that withholding RASi medication compared with continuingtreatment after these adverse events is associated with alower recurrence of adverse events, but conversely a higherrisk of MACE and death, for which prevention is one of themain indications for RASi. 502\u2013506See Section 3.11 on hyperkalemia management.

Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Many children with CKD with un- derlying tubular disorders have an obligate urine output irre- spective of their hydration status and are at particularly high risk of hypotension and AKI during an acute dehydrating illness.Therefore, temporary discontinuation of medications such asdiuretics and RASi that may lead to serious complications ofvolume depletion, such as hypotension and AKI, should beconsidered during illnesses. If medications are discontinuedduring an illness, a clear plan of when to restart the discontinuedmedications should be communicated to people with CKD and documented in the medical record. 4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected bene \ufb01ts and possible risks of medications so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed. People with kidney disease have a role in drug stewardship, and given that they may receive medications from non- nephrology healthcare providers, people with CKD should beencouraged to inform those prescribers that they have kidneydisease to facilitate consideration of doses and potential sideeffect of medications. Thus, education and information forpeople with CKD inclusive for their population (i.e., literacy level and languages) are encouraged. Although brochures and conversations", "may be useful, interactive electronic healthapplications have been shown to be acceptable to patients andmay lead them to apply the knowledge gained more effec-tively. 793\u2013797Practical implementation tips involve printing out the results of the most recent eGFR estimation for thepatient to bring along in future healthcare consultations and/or write down a list of ongoing medications to alert other healthcare providers of medication risks and bene \ufb01ts. A diagnosis of CKD should always be re \ufb02ected in medical records, as this will alert physicians on the need to consider adjusting or avoiding certain medications or procedures.Under-recognition of CKD diagnoses in medical records isassociated with medication errors, including potentiallyinappropriate prescription of nephrotoxic medications. 729 Practice Point 4.3.1.2: Establish collaborative relationshipswith other healthcare providers and pharmacists and/oruse tools to ensure and improve drug stewardship in peoplewith CKD to enhance management of their complexmedication regimens. Clinical pharmacists are highly quali \ufb01ed experts in medi- cines and, as part of the multidisciplinary team, can play apivotal role in improving the quality of care and ensuring patient safety in a range of ways. This includes carrying out structured medication reviews for people with CKD andassociated health problems and improving patient safety,outcomes, and value through a person-centered approach. 798\u2013 800In addition and where clinical pharmacists are not avail- able, clinical decision support systems can optimize thisprocess through automation and decision support integratedinto the EMRs, supporting drug stewardship through alerts to healthcare providers on the need for dose adjustment to prevent adverse effects. In RCTs enrolling people with CKD,electronic clinical decision support systems have demon-strated ef \ufb01cacy in reducing medication errors, avoiding drug- drug interactions, and improving dose adjustment of medi-cations excreted by the kidneys. 801\u2013806Recognizing that many of these tools may not be available in all communities, theconcepts of regular review and evaluation of medications by a knowledgeable healthcare provider are a critical component of care for people with CKD. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Parents and carers should be cen- tral to drug stewardship for children with CKD, withincreasing involvement from the young person as they movetoward transition. 4.4 Imaging studies Practice Point 4.4.1: Consider the indication for imagingstudies in accordance with general population indications.Risks and bene \ufb01ts of imaging studies should be determined on an individual basis in the context of their CKD. The use of iodinated radiocontrast media has been asso- ciated with the occurrence of AKI, with varying rates reportedin observational studies depending on the population studied,the type, route and dose of agent being used, and the de \ufb01- nition of nephrotoxicity. The term \u201ccontrast-induced AKI \u201d has been traditionally coined to describe this condition, 807but subsequent research characterizing this entity suggests causallinks to be weak, 807\u2013809and the term \u201ccontrast-associated AKI (CA-AKI) \u201dhas been suggested instead. Although there is potential risk for AKI with contrast administration in people with CKD G4 \u2013G5, caution should be exercised in withholding contrast treatment or evaluation of apotentially fatal condition solely based on GFR. 810,811HarmTable 32 | Medications that should be considered for temporary discontinuation before elective surgeries", "and potential perioperative adverse events associated with theircontinued use Medications Potential perioperative adverse events ACEi/ARB Hypotension, AKI Diuretics Volume depletion, AKI SGLT2i Ketoacidosis (starvation or diabetes) Metformin Lactic acidosis if AKI occurs Aminoglycosides Acute tubular necrosis/AKI NSAIDs AKI, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) ACEi, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; AKI, acute kidney injury; ARB, angiotensin II receptor blocker; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-in \ufb02ammatory drug; SGLT2i, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S252 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 may be induced through delaying, not performing, or providing suboptimal diagnostic/therapeutic imagingprocedures due to fear of contrast-associated complicationsto people with reduced GFR. 811,812Table 33813describes the potential causes of CA-AKI identi \ufb01ed in available studies that may suggest an approach to people with CKD. 4.4.1 Radiocontrast: intra-arterial and intravenous dye studies Practice Point 4.4.1.1: Assess the risk for AKI in peoplewith CKD receiving intra-arterial contrast for cardiac procedures using validated tools. The reported risk of CA-AKI is higher with procedures involving arterial administration compared with venous administration of contrast. 814This difference in risk may be due to differences in patient populations (those who requirearterial contrast are likely to have comorbidities thatincrease the likelihood of AKI) or to differences in thenephrotoxicity of intra-arterial contrast material. Known risk factors for CA-AKI are advanced age, heart failure, the volume of contrast material, proteinuria, hyper-glycemia, and use of RASi. 815The highest risk for AKI is associated with interventional (rather than diagnostic)coronary angiography (particularly in the setting of acutemyocardial infarction). This may relate to the highervolume of contrast used in interventional procedures andhemodynamic instability associated with the clinical situation. 815\u2013817 Practice Point 4.4.1.2: The intravenous administration of radiocontrast media can be managed in accordance withconsensus statements from the radiology societies in peoplewith AKI or GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(CKD G3a \u2013G5) undergoing elective investigation. The Work Group refers the reader to the most recent radiology guidelines speci \ufb01cally noting the difference between intravenous and intra-arterial radiocontrast: /C15Use of low-osmolality contrast media and iso-osmolaritycontrast media/C15Use of minimum radiocontrast dose to achieve a diagnosticstudy /C15Withdrawal of nonessential potentially nephrotoxic medi-cations (e.g., NSAIDs, diuretics, aminoglycosides, ampho- tericin, platins, zoledronate, and methotrexate) in people with AKI or eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2for 24 \u201348 hours before and 48 hours after radiocontrast exposure /C15In people with eGFR >30 ml/min per 1.73 m2and without evidence of AKI, metformin need not be stopped beforeiodinated contrast media (ICM) administration, and thereis no need for testing to evaluate GFR afterward. For peoplewith AKI or an eGFR #30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, it remains appropriate to stop metformin at the time of or before ICMinjection and should not be restarted for at least 48 hoursand only then if GFR remains stable and the ongoing use ofmetformin has been reassessed by the clinical team. 818 /C15Given the lack of strong evidence demonstrating thatcontinuing RAASi is bene \ufb01cial, referring healthcare pro- viders should consider withholding RAASi in people at riskfor$48 hours before elective contrast-enhanced CT to avoid the potential for hypotension and hyperkalemiashould CA-AKI develop. RAASi may be", "restarted if CA-AKIdoes not occur or after the return of GFR to baseline. /C15Consideration of avoiding dehydration for people not un-dergoing dialysis and who have eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2or AKI and receiving intravenous contrast.815,819 /C15Use of N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, furosemide, dopa-mine, fenoldopam, or calcium channel blockers as pre- ventative measures of CA-AKI has not been shown to be a consistent bene \ufb01t. 813 /C15Prophylactic pericontrast hemodialysis has been shown tobe potentially harmful and is not recommended. 813 Special considerations Global access to contrast agents. The preference of contrast agent may depend on availability and cost, particularly inlower-income countries and lower-middle \u2013income countries. 4.4.2 Gadolinium-containing contrast media Gadolinium chelates used during magnetic resonance imag-ing has previously been reported to cause nephrogenic sys-temic \ufb01brosis (NSF) before 2010, and the mechanisms have been articulated. 820Note that incidence of this condition has not been reported later than 2012, thus raising the question asto the true risk of this condition. 821 Practice Point 4.4.2.1: For people with GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2(CKD G4 \u2013G5) who require gadolinium-con- taining contrast media, preferentially offer them AmericanCollege of Radiology group II and III gadolinium-basedcontrast agents.

There are cost implications in lower-income countries and lower-middle \u2013 income countries as the nonlinear-chelated preparations aremore expensive. Pediatric considerations. Considerations speci \ufb01c to the use of gadolinium preparations in young children and neonates mustalso be contemplated in addition to the general admonishmentsagainst their use in situations of GFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. In particular, the FDA currently does not license any gadolin-ium-based contrast media product for use", "in children <2 years of age and, likewise, the European Medicines Agency cautionsagainst the use of any gadolinium-based contrast agents in achild<1 year of age. The risk of NSF in pediatric populations appears to be low, but data are limited. 822,823In recognition of the inability to accurately measure GFR in the neonate and, by extension, the clearance of compoundssuch as gadolinium, all nephrologists and radiologists mustexercise caution in terms of use of gadolinium-based contrast media in this potentially high-risk population, and all other imaging modalities should be considered before choosing onerequiring gadolinium exposure. Although not based on spe-ci\ufb01c evidence, some have suggested the avoidance of high-risk gadolinium agents in very young children (e.g., neonatesyounger than 4 weeks of age). 826 Moreover because of kidney immaturity in fetuses, neo- nates, and infants, this population (and consequently preg- nant women because of the risk to the fetus) is considered potentially at risk for NSF.827However, although the data are limited, the number of reported cases of NSF in the pediatricpopulation is lower than in the adult population. 828There is no convincing evidence that pediatric populations havea ni n c r e a s e dr i s kc o m p a r e dw i t ha d u l t s .T h er i s ko fN S Fin pediatric patients appears to be low, but data arelimited. 823 For research recommendations, please see Chapter 6: Research recommendations.chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S254 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Chapter 5: Optimal models of care 5.1 Referral to specialist kidney care services Early identi \ufb01cation and referral to specialist kidney care ser- vices for people with CKD has the potential to reverse, delay, or prevent progression of disease and is a key focus of in-ternational initiatives in the context of the global \u201cepidemic \u201d of kidney disease. The goals of early identi \ufb01cation and referral to specialist kidney care services are several-fold and include: /C15Ensuring a speci \ufb01c diagnosis for CKD is sought, where appropriate /C15Provision of speci \ufb01c therapy based on diagnosis /C15Slowing/arresting CKD progression /C15Evaluation and management of comorbid conditions /C15Prevention and management of CVD /C15Identi \ufb01cation, prevention, and management of CKD-spe- ci\ufb01c complications (e.g., malnutrition, anemia, bone dis- ease, and acidosis) /C15Planning and preparation for KRT (e.g., choice of modality,access-placement and care, and preemptive transplantation)/C15Psychosocial support /C15Provision of conservative care and palliative care optionswhere required. Practice Point 5.1.1: Refer adults with CKD to specialistkidney care services in the circumstances listed inFigure 48 : The scope of nephrology practice includes a wide variety of conditions, not only kidney failure but also acute and chronic primary and systemic diseases involving individual elements of the kidney, resistant hypertension, and biochemical de-rangements. Thus, there are many potential bene \ufb01ts of nephrology referral in addition to those more commonlyrecognized such as identi \ufb01cation of reversible causes of CKD, provision of treatment to slow progression of CKD, man-agement of the metabolic complications of CKD, and prep-aration for dialysis and transplantation. Central to achieving the", "best outcomes for people with CKD regardless of the reason for referral is timeliness.

Specialistreferral to aid in ascertainment of cause and prognosis can be seen as separate from care and support services targeted at complications, and delay of, and preparation for progressiveCKD. Application of risk prediction tools (Chapter 2) may aiddecision-making in terms of identifying those at risk ofprogression and determining action thresholds for multidis-ciplinary care and placement of access for KRT or referral totransplantation. Current recommendations to use validatedrisk equations to ascertain those at high probability of kidney failure within 2 years should prompt actions that align with provision of appropriate education activities, review of un-derstanding, and decision-making, and prompting referrals toother healthcare providers (e.g., vascular access surgeons,transplant teams, etc.). Risk-based referral was compared with guideline referral criteria in a cross-sectional study from the UK. 829Analysis revealed that approximately 40% of patients classi \ufb01ed as at high risk of progression to kidney failure by KFRE ( >3% by 5 years) were missed by guideline referral criteria. Moreover, amodel predicting the timing of clinical outcomes, validated ina multicenter prospective cohort study of 1517 people aged$65 years with eGFR 10 \u201330 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, showed good performance for predicting the timing and occurrenceof KRT. Using this prediction model to guide referral forvascular access preparation resulted in less unnecessary arteriovenous \ufb01stula surgeries than using eGFR thresholds. 830 In this section, we consider the evidence relating", "to timely referral for planning KRT in people with progressive CKD. The literature concerning late referral has been remarkablyconsistent with both clinical studies and narrative reviewsidentifying several adverse consequences of late referral andrelated bene \ufb01ts of early referral ( Table 34 ). Both individual and healthcare system factors are associ- ated with late referral for KRT planning. A systematic reviewof 18 studies and physician surveys identi \ufb01ed speci \ufb01c factorsresponsible for late referral for KRT as shown in Table 35 . 831 We encourage each nephrology program to explore factorsassociated with late referral to improve referral patternsappropriately. People with kidney disease have never been randomized to early or late referral to nephrology services, and the de \ufb01nition of late referral in the published studies varies between 1 and 12months before the start of KRT. Three months is probably lessthan the absolute minimum amount of time required forassessment, education, preparation for KRT, and creation ofaccess, but 3 months is the most frequently employed de \ufb01nition. A systematic review of 40 studies showed that early referral was associated with better clinical and biochemical outcomessuch as improvement in mortality at 3 and 5 years, decrease inhospitalizations, better access to vascular access and KRT withperitoneal dialysis, as well as improvements in BP , hemoglobin,and serum albumin ( Table 36 ). 832A retrospective study of 105,219 patients (early referral 21,024 patients and late referral84,195 patients) showed that early referral to nephrology carewas associated with slower progression of CKD as signi \ufb01cantly more patients in early referral group did not change their CKDstage (65% \u201372.9% vs. 52% \u201364.6%, P<0.05). 833 Local practice and resources will dictate local referral practices. Regardless of the healthcare system, delay, or pre-vention of progression of both CKD and its complicationswill be of value to both individuals and healthcare systems.Local organizations will determine the best methods ofcommunication and interaction between people with CKD, kidney care specialists, the multidisciplinary team, and pri- mary care physicians. Technology may be used to promote appropriate nephrology referral. Embedding clinical practice guidelinesinto clinical information systems may effectively create areminder system for primary care physicians. Clinical deci-sion support systems could also improve referral criteriaadherence. The smartphone application, Nefroconsultor, which uses KDIGO referral criteria was shown to increase the rate of appropriate referral by 28.8%. 834Table 34 | Bene \ufb01ts and consequences of early versus late referral Consequences of late referral Bene \ufb01ts of early referral Severe hypertension and \ufb02uid overload, and increased cardiovascular comorbidityDelay requirement for KRT, better management of CVD, and comorbid conditions Low prevalence of permanent access Reduced need for urgent dialysis using temporary access Delayed referral for transplant Greater choice of treatment options and pre-emptive transplantation Higher initial hospitalization rate Reduced hospital length of stay and costs Higher 1-year mortality rate Lower 1-year mortality rate Less choice of KRT modality Increased informed freedom of choice of KRT modality Worse psychosocial adjustment and increase in DALYs Early access to psychosocial counseling and support for care partners Malnutrition Improved nutritional status CVD, cardiovascular disease; DALY, disability-adjusted life-year;", "KRT, kidney replacement therapy.chapter 5 www.kidney-international.org S256 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Implementation of referral guidelines will inevitably lead to an increased workload for specialist kidney care services. However, introduction of local initiatives in conjunction with primary care providers can improve the appropriateness and quality of the referral. A checklist for goal-directed care inCKD should be considered. Local initiatives combined withnational policy and practice changes can lead to animprovement in the outcomes for people with CKD regard-less of the level of resources available. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 5.1.2: Refer children and adolescents tospecialist kidney care services in the followingcircumstances: /C15an ACR of 30 mg/g (3 mg/mmol) or a PCR of 200 mg/g(20 mg/mmol) or more, con \ufb01rmed on a repeat \ufb01rst morning void sample, when well and not duringmenstruation, /C15persistent hematuria, /C15any sustained decrease in eGFR, /C15hypertension, /C15kidney out\ufb02 ow obstruction or anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract, /C15known or suspected CKD, or /C15recurrent urinary tract infection.Children with known or suspected CKD or who are at risk of CKD (as outlined above) should be referred to specialistcare. This allows for timely investigations and diagnosis. Earlyintegration of children with CKD into nephrology services will ensure optimal management of pediatric complications of CKD (including growth restriction) and will promote ac-cess to preemptive transplantation (the KRT of choice). 5.2 Symptoms in CKD 5.2.1 Prevalence and severity of symptoms CKD confers a high burden of uremic symptoms that may beunder-recognized, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. 835As kidney disease progresses, affected people experience anincreasing burden of adverse uremic symptoms. Thesesymptoms can impair their health-related QoL (HRQoL) byinterfering with social relationships, \ufb01nancial instability, and contributing to overall poor well-being. 836Patient-reported outcomes, including HRQoL and symptoms, are oftenidenti \ufb01ed by people with CKD as more important to them than clinical outcomes, such as survival. 837,838A recent systematic review of 126 patient-reported outcome studiesinvolving people with CKD G1 \u2013G5, not on KRT, identi \ufb01ed the most common symptoms experienced in terms of prevalenceand severity in this population ( Figure 49 ). 839The most prevalent symptom reported in the CKD population noton KRT was fatigue at 70% (95% CI: 60% \u201379%), whereas in the identi \ufb01ed control population without CKD, fatigue prevalence was 34% (95% CI: 0% \u201370%). In terms of the symptoms reported as the most severe, sexual dysfunction hadthe highest severity score. This review also looked atpopulations receiving dialysis and/or transplantation, allowingfor the comparison of prevalence and severity across populations. This provides insight into symptoms that may be attributable to changing or deteriorating kidney function andmay provide symptom targets for tracking in the care ofpeople with CKD, especially those with more advanced CKD,such as CKD G5. 5.2.2 Identi \ufb01cation and assessment of symptoms Practice Point 5.2.2.1: Ask people with progressive CKDabout uremic symptoms (e.g., reduced appetite, nausea, andlevel of fatigue/lethargy) at each consultation using a stan-dardized validated assessment of uremic symptoms tool. The identi \ufb01cation and assessment of symptoms in people with progressive CKD are important for highlighting changesin clinical management, 840redirecting treatment toward", "patient-centered management, and may lead to discussionabout appropriate supportive care options. 838Effective 2- way communication and shared decision-making should bekey principles between healthcare providers and the peoplethey treat, allowing them to work in partnership to identify symptom burden, possible treatment strategies, and person- centered solutions. 835,839,841 In the past, it had been challenging to \ufb01nd an accepted standardized approach to assess and report outcomes forTable 36 | Outcomes examined in a systematic review by Smart et al.832 OutcomesRelative risk comparing early vs. late referral Receive permanent vascular access RR: 3.22; 95% CI: 2.92 \u20133.55 Initiation of KRT with peritoneal dialysis RR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.64 \u20131.84 Three-month mortality OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.55 \u20130.67 Five-month mortality OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.60 \u20130.71 OutcomesMean difference in early vs. late referral Initial hospitalization (d) /C09.1; 95% CI: /C010.92 to /C07.32 Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) /C03.09; 95% CI: /C05.23 to /C00.95 Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) /C01.64; 95% CI: /C02.77 to /C00.51 Hemoglobin (g/dl) 2.76; 95% CI: 2.53 to 2.99 Serum albumin (g/dl) 1.92; 95% CI: 1.83 to 2.01 CI, con \ufb01dence interval; KRT, kidney replacement therapy; OR, odds ratio; RR, relative risk.Table 35 | Factors associated with late referral for kidney replacement therapy planning Patient-related factors Healthcare system \u2013related factors Age RaceComorbid illnessEtiology of kidney diseaseNoncompliance or nonadherence Socioeconomic statusHealth insurance statusType of referring physicianType of referring centerHealth system and/or physician rationingDistance to dialysis centerwww.kidney-international.org chapter 5 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S257 those with CKD, and patient reports of their HRQoL are still rarely routinely recorded, despite increasing recognition oftheir importance. 841\u2013843In addition, many of the assessments developed have been for people on dialysis, with little vali-dation in CKD populations not on KRT. In 2019, Verberneet al. 841described an international standard set of outcome measures for people with CKD, developed in conjunction with people with very high \u2013risk CKD G3 \u2013G5. Within this standardized set of outcome measures, there are 4 domains, with one of the domains targeting 6 patient-reportedoutcomes for HRQoL (fatigue, pain, general HRQoL,physical function, depression, and daily activity). To date,there is no consensus on a single preferred patient-reportedoutcome measure (PROM) instrument to be used to assessthese symptoms. However, 3 generic tools have been recommended by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) ( Table 37 ).

The goal of effective symptom management in people with CKD is to assist them to live better with kidney disease,regardless of life expectancy, within a supportive care framework. 838Unpleasant symptoms, such as CKD- associated pruritis and emotional/psychological distress, often occur within symptom clusters and treating onesymptom may potentially alleviate other symptoms. 835 Developing", "treatment strategies can be challenging giventhe complexities of managing CKD in different populationsand the variation in levels of evidence for managing thedifferent symptoms experienced, with many strategies extrapolated from studies of treatments in the generalDecreased appetite Prevalence 42% Severity score: 19.8 Leg swelling Prevalence 45% Severity score: no dataFatigue Prevalence 70% Severity score: 22.8Shortness of breath Prevalence 42% Severity score: 15 Muscle cramps Prevalence 46% Severity score: no data Heartburn Prevalence 46% Severity score: no dataDrowsiness Prevalence 53% Severity score: 22.5 Pain Prevalence 53% Severity score: 22.5Poor mobility Prevalence 56% Severity score: 19 Bone/joint pain Prevalence 55% Severity score: no data Poor sleep Prevalence 49% Severity score: 23.8Sexual dysfunction Prevalence 48% Severity score: 56.4Itching Prevalence 46% Severity score: 25 Figure 49 | Common symptoms, prevalence, and severity in people with chronic kidney disease.

For example, sexual dysfunction, a very common and one of the most severesymptoms described by people with CKD, is fraught withbarriers in terms of research from agreement of de \ufb01nitions, the stigma of sexual dysfunction, acknowledging thedistinction between sex and gender, discordance betweenresearch priorities and patient priorities, and understandingthat there are variable responses to treatment in peoplewith CKD. 847However, there has been some consensus that there is suf \ufb01cient evidence to support guidance for some symptoms such as uremic pruritis, sleep disturbances,pain, depression, and restless leg syndrome, 838but future research is needed to understand the determinants ofsymptoms such as chronic pain and evaluation ofmanagement strategies. 848Table 38838,840,849\u2013871provides an", "overview of the most common symptoms in CKD.

It can also be associated with worse outcomes with kidney transplant. 874The risk of PEW increasesas CKD progresses but is also in \ufb02uenced by comorbid conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and CVD.PEW is thought to be driven by the damaging effect of uremictoxins on appetite and chronic in \ufb02ammation. 873\u2013875Given the impact on prognosis and QoL, nutritional assessment andintervention (ideally by a renal", "dietitian or accredited nutritionprovider) using a validated assessment tool should beundertaken for people with CKD who present with frailty, age>65 years, weight loss, poor growth (pediatrics), poor appetite, and all people with CKD G4 and G5 ( Table 39 876\u2013878).Table 38 | (Continued) Management strategies for common symptoms in CKD Symptom CommentManagement strategies Lifestyle Pharmacological Other Depression May be related to CKD burden and perception, loss of control, and medication effects.

An optimal care model leads to the best outcomes for the individual, the population, and the community. The model ofcare varies according to CKD severity and risk of progressionto kidney failure, which will determine the target population and goals ( Figure 50 ). CKD models of care follow the same principles embodied in the chronic disease model of care ( Figure 51 879). Each keycomponent of the chronic care model is applied to the CKD care model. The speci \ufb01c components for CKD models of care are presented in Figure 52 and include: (i) Navigation system that leads to appropriate and timely referral. This relies on a good healthcare system (ii) An education program that includes both general CKD and KRT education, including conservativemanagement, where appropriate (iii) Surveillance", "protocols for laboratory and clinic visits, attention to cardiovascular comorbidities, and CKD-associated comorbidities such as anemia, a vaccina- tion program (iv) Management that includes self-care management particularly lifestyle modi \ufb01cation including diet,Table 39 | List of validated assessment tools for malnutrition Validated malnutrition assessment tool Attributes 7-Point Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)876Provides assessment points on weight change, dietary intake, digestive function, functional capacity,and metabolic stress. A nutrition focused physical examination is also performed. This updated versionof the SGA is more sensitive to short-term nutrition changes. A score of 1 \u20132 indicates severe malnutrition, 3\u20135 is mild malnutrition, and 6 \u20137 indicates normal nutrition status. Malnutrition-In \ufb02ammation Score 877Assesses malnutrition and in \ufb02ammation using 10 parameters including dietary intake, anthropometric measurements, laboratory indices, and functional capacity. The score ranges from 0 (normal) to30 (severe malnutrition and in \ufb02ammation). Mini Nutrition Assessment 878Includes assessment of dietary intake, mobility, neuropsychology, and some anthropometric measurements,including weight and calf circumference. A score of 12 \u201314 points indicates normal nutrition status, 8\u201311 indicates at risk for malnutrition, and 0 \u20137 points indicates malnutrition.

Standardized educational topics should cover 3 main subject areas: knowledge about CKD, knowledge about treatment to slow progression and complications of CKD, andknowledge about the kidney failure management options. Educational material should be written and explained clearly with plain language. Customization of information topatient needs and literacy level, and sensitive to cultural norms and needs (i.e., storytelling/videos vs. written mate- rials). A multidisciplinary approach should be encouraged asan effective strategy for providing education. Engaging com-munity healthcare workers and other health educationproviders may be an effective strategy for providing patient/ carer education and empowering self-care management. 883 Targeting education to people with CKD who are at high risk of CKD progression might yield a better outcome thanroutine care not only to the individual but also to thehealthcare system. Engaging with family members orcaregivers in a CKD education program will facilitate self-care management and psychosocial support.

KRT, kidney replacement therapy.www.kidney-international.org chapter 5 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S263 Telehealth has been used increasingly in medicine, including nephrology, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has the potential to augment patient care in CKDin many aspects such as improving access to CKD care in outreach patients, increasing patient monitoring ability, helping with healthcare provider shortage, and improvingpatient satisfaction. Telehealth in nephrology ( \u201cTele- nephrology \u201d) can be categorized into 3 main areas: (i) remote monitoring, (ii) providing education, and (iii) delivery ofcare. These have been implemented in 4 main platformsincluding internet web-based, smartphone applications,interactive video conferencing, and wearable technology. Remote monitoring technology has been designed to promote self-care management through oversight of clinicalparameters so people with CKD can monitor changes athome, such as BP , body weight, or abnormal symptoms. 884,885 This may encourage people with CKD to participate in themanagement of CKD. Telehealth technologies that enhance education in people with CKD have been reported in various forms. Web-based applications are probably the most popular platform used to provide education for people with CKD and their families. 886 Systematic reviews suggest that web-based CKD materials aremostly adequate but not written at a suitable literacy level formost people with CKD. 887,888 Smart phone applications have been increasingly adopted for patient education in CKD. Educational material can beinstalled into smartphone applications as a tool for on-de- mand knowledge. Moreover, smartphones applications that provide self-care management support for people with CKDwere reported in a pilot study. 889The application targeted 4 key self-care management parameters: monitoring BP,medication management, symptom assessment, andtracking laboratory results. Lastly, interactive videoconferencing can provide patient education simultaneouslywith a virtual visit. 890,891This strategy should not be intended to replace the clinic visit but would be helpful fordealing with any event that happens between follow-upface-to-face visits, such as follow-up of clinical symptomsafter starting or adjusting medication. Examples oftelehealth technologies that were studied in people withCKD are shown in Figure 54 . Standardized and culturally appropriate protocols should be considered. Although it is recognized that resources may vary across and within jurisdictions, the recommendations here are based on principles of care, which should be relevantacross the globe. CKD is a complex condition that coexists with many other conditions. Therefore, models of care should be developedthat integrate the complexity of the clinical conditionsinvolved, patient-centered philosophies, and the healthcareenvironment. The principles of care are universal, but implementation may be customized to speci \ufb01c circumstances. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. 5.3.1 Transition from pediatric to adult care 5.3.1.1 Pediatric providers Practice Point 5.3.1.1.1: Prepare adolescents and their families for transfer to adult-oriented care", "starting at 11 \u201314 years of age by using checklists to assess readiness andguide preparation, and by conducting part of each visitwithout the parent/guardian present ( Figure 55 ). Practice Point 5.3.1.1.2: Provide a comprehensive writtentransfer summary, and ideally an oral handover, to thereceiving healthcare providers including all relevant med-ical information as well as information about the youngperson \u2019s cognitive abilities and social support ( Figure 55 ). Practice Point 5.3.1.1.3: Transfer young people to adult careduring times of medical and social stability where possible. Although several organizations have made recommendations about transition from pediatric to adult care, there have been norandomized trials to test the effectiveness of speci \ufb01ca p - proaches. 892\u2013894Nevertheless, there is general agreement that preparation for transfer to adult care should start as early as 11years of age and certainly by 14 years when possible. 895An u m b e r of tools are available to guide preparation. Checklists to assess CKD care aspects Domains Platforms Remote monitoring Education strategies Delivery of careAsynchronous Synchronous Asynchronous Synchronous Asynchronous SynchronousWearable technology Web-based with interactive application Web-based and smartphone applications Interactive video conferencing Smartphone applications Interactive video conferencing Telehealth Figure 54 | Telehealth technologies for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).chapter 5 www.kidney-international.org S264 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 readiness (i.e., TRxANSITION, Y outh Quiz from the On Trac program, Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire(TRAQ), Readiness for Transition Questionnaire (RTQ), andGot Transition tools http://www.gottransition.org ) are useful to identify the areas of weakness. 896\u2013899Young people should gradually be prepared for full autonomy with medical visits. Seeing the young person alone before inviting caregivers into the room allows young people to practice interacting withhealthcare providers independently and provides privacy forthe discussion of sensitive topics. Good communication between the transferring and receiving care teams is a cornerstone of successful transitions.A comprehensive written medical summary must be provided;a verbal handover is ideal. Because childhood CKD may be associated with neurodevelopmental disabilities, a clear description of the young person \u2019s cognitive abilities, including strengths and weaknesses that may in \ufb02uence their ability for self-care management, is critical. Information about socialsupport available to young people is also important. Healthcare transitions are well known to be strongly associated with adverse outcomes, including loss to follow-up.Transferring during periods of instability is ill-advised and may amplify the risk of poor outcomes. 894To minimize the risk of loss to follow-up, pediatric care providers should follow-up with patients to ensure that they have engagedwith the new care team. Transition clinics may improve the outcomes of young people transitioning from pediatric to adult care. 900,901 Transition clinics may be staffed exclusively by pediatriccare providers and focus on preparation, or may be jointly staffed by pediatric and adult providers. 895,902Although joint pediatric-adult clinics are viewed as ideal, their superiority has not been demonstrated in randomized trials.Furthermore, feasibility may be limited by funding,geography, and staf \ufb01ng. Young people should have the opportunity to visit the adult clinic before transfer.5.3.1.2 Adult providers Practice Point 5.3.1.2.1: Recognize that young people under25 years", "of age with CKD are a unique population at highrisk for adverse outcomes at least in part due to physiologicincomplete brain maturation. Practice Point 5.3.1.2.2: Encourage young people to infor- mally visit the adult care clinic to which they will be transferred before the \ufb01rst appointment ( Figure 55 ). Practice Point 5.3.1.2.3: Assess young people with CKDmore frequently than older people with the same stage ofCKD and, with the agreement of the young person, includethe caregivers or signi \ufb01cant other of the young person in their care, at least in the \ufb01rst 1\u2013 3 years following transfer from pediatric care ( Figure 55 ). Even for young people without chronic illness, the interval between 14 and 25 years of age is a period of change andincreasing autonomy. Young people with CKD undergoingtransfer to adult care must navigate 2 transitions simulta- neously: the transition of care and the larger transition from childhood to adulthood. Development of the prefrontal cor-tex, responsible for planning, organization, and impulsecontrol, continues to approximately 25 years of age. Adultcare providers must recognize that young adults constitute ahigh-risk population requiring special care. 903Outcomes are poorer during this interval than at other times of life.904 Care must re \ufb02ect the fact that this is a high-risk period. An informal visit to the new clinic setting may help in reducing stress, improving engagement, and reducing loss tofollow-up. 895In the initial years after transfer, visits should be more frequent than for older adults with the same stage ofCKD to provide an opportunity for care providers to establisha relationship with the young person, reduce the risk of loss tofollow-up, improve adherence to medications, and provide TransitionPreparation for transfer Pediatric carePreparation for regular adult care Joint pediatric-adult care or Young adult careTransition Regular adult careTransfer \u2013 when stable\u2022 Allow young people to visit the clinic before transfer \u2022 Recognize that \u201cemerging adulthood\u201d is a period of high risk for adverse outcomes \u2022 See emerging adults more frequently than older adults with same stage of CKD \u2022 Include caregivers or significant others in patient visits, with permission of patient Age (years) 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\u2022 Start early (11\u201314 yr) \u2022 Use checklists to assess readiness and guide preparation \u2022 See young person alone for at least part of each visit \u2022 Comprehensive written summary and verbal handover, including cognitive ability and social support \u2022 Follow-up after transfer Figure 55 | The process of transition from pediatric to adult care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).www.kidney-international.org chapter 5 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S265 enhanced monitoring of a group at high risk of adverse outcomes. Although young adults must have an opportunityto meet their care providers alone, many will continue todesire and need involvement of parents or signi \ufb01cant others in their care. This is a normal part of development, is associatedwith better outcomes, and should be encouraged. 895 Multidisciplinary young adult clinics including youth workers, social workers, pharmacists, and psychologists", "inaddition to physicians and nurses may be bene \ufb01cial. 900Peer- support programs have also shown promise.904 5.4 Timing the initiation of dialysis Practice Point 5.4.1: Initiate dialysis based on a compositeassessment of a person \u2019s symptoms, signs, QoL, prefer- ences, level of GFR, and laboratory abnormalities. Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one or more of the following situations is evident ( Table 41 ). This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR rangebetween 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults when the GFR is <15\u201320 ml/min per 1.73 m2or risk of KRT is >40% over 2 years. These statements are worded very precisely to highlight the need to plan proactively for complex activities related toinitiation of KRT. Also, there is a need to address symptomsand to avoid the institution of dialysis therapy at an arbitrarynumber representing the degree of residual kidney function. Given the risks and bene \ufb01ts of KRT, as well as the potential imprecision of measurements, people with CKD need to be treated according to symptoms and signs, not simply basedon laboratory values. Data from the Initiating Dialysis Earlyand Late (IDEAL) RCT show no survival advantage to earlystart dialysis (i.e., at higher levels of GFR). 905Thus, the statement as written should help the healthcare provider tobalance symptoms with laboratory values in decision-making. Secondary analyses of the IDEAL study showed no signi \ufb01- cant difference in QoL or healthcare\u2013 related cost between early and late start dialysis groups. 905,906Moreover, subgroup analysis of the IDEAL study revealed no bene \ufb01ts on cardiac outcome in the early-start dialysis group.907Since the IDEAL study, there were a number of large sample size observationalstudies with an advanced statistical technique to reducepossible confounding factors and biases encountered in previous observational studies. 908\u2013910The overall results wereconsistent with the IDEAL study and showed no bene \ufb01ts of early-start dialysis compared with late-start dialysis in regard to mortality and hospitalization risk ( Table 42905\u2013909). Factors such as availability of resources, reasons for starting dialysis, timing of dialysis initiation, patient education andpreparedness, dialysis modality and access, as well as varied\u201ccountry-speci \ufb01c\u201dfactors signi \ufb01cantly affect a person \u2019s expe- riences and outcomes. As the burden of kidney failurehas increased globally, there has also been a growing recogni-tion of the importance of patient involvement in determiningthe goals of care and decisions regarding treatment. It isimportant to move away from a \u201cone-size- \ufb01ts-all\u201dapproach to dialysis and provide more individualized or personalized care. The availability of resources for formal multidisciplinary teams, educational materials, and access to specialized counselingfor diet, advance directives, access planning, and preemptivetransplantation varies around the world. These statements areproposed so that \u201cbest practices \u201dcan be documented or aspired to. The need for education, planning, and appropriate expertisefor the management of this patient group is internationally relevant. The methods, frequency, and tools with which this can be accomplished will be region speci \ufb01c. There is a need to focus on regular", "symptom assessment as part of the CKD review in those with lower eGFR values.Individual assessment and availability of resources will dictatespeci\ufb01c timing of therapies. Healthcare providers should be aware of the impact of early dialysis start on QoL beforerecommending this strategy to people with CKD. Recognition that the planning of smooth transition to either dialysis or transplantation from advanced CKD re-quires alignment of multiple different resources and activities,as such the planning for these will be situation speci \ufb01c. It is important to recognize that there is variability in the avail-ability of vascular access services or peritoneal dialysis cath-eter insertion for those who choose hemodialysis orperitoneal dialysis, respectively, and access to preemptive transplantation. The complexity of the decision-making and different teams and resources required to effectively transitionpeople often requires time, and thus the recommendation tobegin \u201cplanning of KRT \u201dis intentionally advised at a con- servative time point. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 5.4.4: In children, in addition to the adultindications for dialysis, poor growth refractory to opti-mized nutrition, growth hormone, and medical manage-ment is an indication for initiating KRT. Table 41 | Indications for the initiation of dialysis Symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure (e.g., neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-based or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities) Inability to control volume status or blood pressureProgressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention, or cognitive impairmentchapter 5 www.kidney-international.org S266 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 Practice Point 5.4.5: Pursue living or deceased donor pre- emptive kidney transplantation as the treatment of choicefor children in whom there is evidence of progressive andirreversible CKD. The eGFR at which preemptive trans-plantation should be undertaken will depend on multiplefactors including the age and size of the child and the rateof progression of kidney failure but will usually be between eGFR 5\u2013 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. In children, poor growth can also be a reason to initiate dialysis. The decision to start dialysis should be reached in discussion with the child (if age appropriate), their caregivers,and their healthcare providers. Medical and psychosocialpreparations for the initiation of dialysis should begin wellbefore dialysis is required. Deferred initiation should not imply deferred preparation, and early discussions regarding medical and psychosocialpreparation for the initiation of dialysis should not be delayed(e.g., placement of dialysis access, dialysis modality selection, advance care planning, and assistance with home therapies). In children, studies from the USRDS, the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN), and the Australia and NewZealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) foundno bene \ufb01t from starting dialysis early. 911\u2013913Of 15,000 inci- dent children on dialysis in the USRDS, the mortality risk was36% higher for those with eGFR >10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 compared with those with lower eGFR at dialysis initiation.912 Mortality risk increased in those starting dialysis with eGFR<5 and$12 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with a greater risk in people 6 years and older.914A retrospective ESPN study of nearly 3000 children found that mortality", "did not differwhen dialysis was started with an eGFR above or below 8ml/min per 1.73 m 2.911These observational data may be confounded by indication bias.Table 42 | Studies examining the timing of dialysis in people with CKD Study Study design Comparison/study populations Outcomes Results Cooper et al. 2010: IDEAL study905RCT Late start group (eGFR CG5\u20137 ml/min per 1.73 m2) Early start group (eGFR CG10\u201314 ml/min per 1.73 m2)Mortality HR with early initiation, 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83 \u20131.30; P\u00bc0.75 Harris et al. 2011906Post hoc analysis of IDEAL studyLate start group (eGFR CG5\u20137 ml/min per 1.73 m2) Early start group (eGFR CG10\u201314 ml/min per 1.73 m2)CostQuality of lifeNo statistical difference between early start vs.late start group Whalley et al. 2013 907Post hoc analysis of IDEAL studyLate start group (eGFR CG5\u20137 ml/min per 1.73 m2) Early start group (eGFR CG10\u201314 ml/min per 1.73 m2)Change in cardiacstructure andfunction (LVMI, LVEF,LAVI) over 12 monthsand between groupsNo statistically signi \ufb01cant change in cardiac structure and function over 12-month follow-up.

Practice Point 5.5.2: Support comprehensive conservative management as an option for people who choose not topursue KRT. Practice Point 5.5.3: Provide access to resources that enable the delivery of advanced care planning for people with arecognized need for end-of-life care, including those", "peopleundergoing comprehensive conservative care. These statements are intended to highlight the importance of supportive care and the need for comprehensive conser-vative care processes and resources in the care of this complexpatient group. The term supportive care in nephrology meanscare that is focused on improving the HRQoL for people withCKD at any severity or age and can be provided along withtherapies intended to prolong life, such as dialysis. 838 Although typically considered in people with advanced kidney disease, supportive care may be applicable to people in earlier CKD stages. Whereas comprehensive conservativemanagement is usually referred to as active medicalmanagement in people with kidney failure who choose notto have KRT. There are 3 distinct groups of people withkidney failure who receive comprehensive conservative carebecause provision of supportive care differs for each. 915 Descriptions of each group are shown in Table 43 . There is increasing recognition that provision of organized care to those who are dying or choose to not pursue KRT is ofvalue to people with CKD and their families. Healthcareproviders involved in caring for these people should be aler-ted to this need. Comprehensive conservative care is an alternative treat- ment to KRT. This is planned, holistic, person-centered carethat includes the full integration of comprehensive conser- vative care including the following: /C15Detailed communication including estimating prognosis and advance care planning /C15Shared decision-making /C15Active symptom assessment and management /C15Psychological, social, family, cultural, and spiritual support/C15Interventions to delay progression and minimize risksof adverse events or complications, but not includingdialysis. Evaluating the prognosis of each person with CKD is very important because each person has a different disease pro-gression pattern. Patient prognosis is the key information forshared decision-making in CKD G5, which requires unbiasedinformation on survival and person-centered outcomesknown to matter to people with CKD: QoL, symptomburden, and support from family and healthcare providers.Shared decision-making helps healthcare providers, peoplewith CKD, and family members to reach agreement on the treatment direction that is appropriate with the person \u2019s values and preferences and family goals. This process should be performed in a culturally appropriate way with consider-ation of appropriate health literacy. As CKD progresses, the person with CKD will experi- ence more symptoms and complications related to CKD.Therefore, active symptom assessment and managementare the key components of comprehensive conservative care in CKD G5. Assessing a person \u2019ss y m p t o m so na regular basis helps redirect management toward a person \u2019s values and preferences and family goals. There is limited evidence for selecting treatment strategies due to thecomplexity of CKD and differences in people and theconsiderable variation in the management strategies fordifferent symptoms. Intervention to delay progression ofCKD is still an important component of comprehensive conservative care in both CKD-related aspects (maintain residual kidney function and reduce cardiovascularmorbidity) and psychospiritual aspects (the person andtheir family members do not feel that active CKD treat-ment is discontinued). Advanced care planning (ACP) is a process under the comprehensive conservative care umbrella that involves un-derstanding, communication, and discussion between a per- son with CKD, the family, caregiver,", "and healthcare providers for the purpose of clarifying preferences for end-of-life care.End-of-life care is the treatment during the phase where deathis inevitable. It focuses on QoL not quantity of lifetime.Functional and cognitive decline that may happen along withCKD progression results in dif \ufb01cult end-of-life conversations involving people with CKD, families, and healthcare pro-viders. Therefore, an integrated approach to timely ACP and Table 43 | People with kidney failure who receive comprehensive conservative care Category Description Receiving conservative care Conservative care that is chosen or medically advised.

End-of-life care is underused in the management ofpeople with CKD G5 due to inadequate education duringnephrology training leading to poor end-of-life care discus- sions with the person. The overall concept of supportive care, comprehensive conservative care, and end-of-life care isshown in Figure 56 . In different societies or cultural areas, the form and structure of this care may vary tremendously, and familiesor religious organizations may be able to deliver suitableand sensitive care. The details here are listed not to beprescriptive but rather to articulate the best practices incommunities where resources may be available and to serveas a construct to review in those locations where resourcesare more limited. ACP is thought to be a component of all comprehensive chronic disease management. Thus, ACP discussions are notrestricted only to those choosing supportive care.

Kidney supportive care emphasizes efforts to optimize quality of life and relieve suffering in people with kidney disease. This emphasis should be present for people undergoing comprehensive conservative care, as well as those who transition to end-of-life care. CKD, chronic kidney diseasewww.kidney-international.org chapter 5 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117\u2013S314 S269 Chapter 6: Research recommendations The last 30 years have seen an exponential growth in the literature relating to", "kidney disease. However, despite thisinclusion of people with CKD in prospective RCTs, those withlower GFR remain under-represented. Before the KDIGO2012 CKD guideline, a low eGFR was an exclusion criterionfor almost every large cardiovascular and BP trial. As a result,we had a largely opinion-based literature. That is changing, and although still low, the proportion of the total CKD literature that is either an RCT, meta-analysis, or systematicreview has doubled from 3.3% to 6.5% of published articlesin the 5-year period ending December 2022. Several large international interventional studies have been completed in the last 8 years, either speci \ufb01cally tar- geting people with CKD and other comorbidities (mostnotably diabetes or CVD), or with CKD de \ufb01ned by eGFR and ACR criteria (e.g., Canagli \ufb02ozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation[CREDENCE], 514DAPA-CKD,513EMPA-KIDNEY,403 FIGARO-DKD,534and FIDELIO-DKD533). Interventional studies targeting speci \ufb01c pathways and diseases are increasing as well, though limited in scale due to rarity ofconditions (e.g., IgAN, membranous nephropathy, andsystemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). There remain gaps in the evidence base to inform best diagnostic testing strategies, decision-making, and processesof care. In addition, some therapies offering promise have notyet been adequately tested in people de \ufb01ned by speci \ufb01c criteria with CKD (i.e., people without diabetes, children,women, PKD, frail, elderly, etc.) and people from low-incomeand low-middle-income countries. We, therefore, begin thissection detailing research recommendations with some gen- eral guiding principles for those designing studies to consider when addressing key questions that impact people living withor at risk for CKD. Guiding principles for research 1. To ensure that the evidence base is directly applicable to all people with CKD, future studies should avoid auto-matic exclusion of older people, children, and youngadults<18 years old, and give consideration to pregnant and lactating people. The need for contraceptive re-quirements for trial participation should also be reviewed. 2. Decreased GFR should not be a reason for automatic exclusion from research studies. 3. Estimating equations equally applicable to those with and without CKD are required for children and adolescents.4. For new equations predicting CVD and mortality risk as well as CKD progression, development andimplementation studies including validation in differentpopulations (geographic and demographic) arerequired. 5. Bene \ufb01t-risk ratio assessments of old, new, and future medications should be performed by levels of GFR and ACR and/or using validated risk equations. 6. Drug studies evaluating pharmacodynamics should consider using validated eGFR equations or mGFR for highly toxic drugs with a narrow therapeutic window,especially for those frequently used in CKD. As this maybe prohibitively expensive for some medications, epide-miologic studies may provide information for revisions tolabels for some drugs. 7. Pharmacokinetic studies in people with CKD should not automatically exclude GFR categories G4 and G5. 8. Studies should consider measurement of ACR in all co- horts, whether speci \ufb01cally focused on CKD or not, given additional prognostic value of this parameter for so manyoutcomes. 9. All studies should ensure attention to etiology of CKD, sex, gender, age, and SES considerations in design and analysis of results. 10. Use of novel study", "designs (platform, registry-embedded, and pragmatic trials), use of large administrative datasets, and implementation science methodologies (e.g., causalinference techniques) should be considered to enable theassessment and evaluation of interventions, processes, andmodels of care. 11. People living with CKD should be involved in clinical studies throughout the research process from identi \ufb01ca- tion of knowledge gaps to knowledge mobilization andstudy design. The following set of more speci \ufb01c research recommenda- tions are organized according to chapter and are notexhaustive. They are generated in part from identifying gapsin knowledge during the evidence review and in part fromclinical practice and patient perspectives.

Chapter 3.

Commissioning of Work Group and ERT. KDIGO and the Co-Chairs assembled and engaged a Work Group withexpertise in pediatric, adult, and geriatric nephrology,including both dialysis and transplant specialists; primarycare; internal medicine; dietetics; nursing; women \u2019s health; clinical trials; epidemiology; medical decision-making; andpublic health; as well as people living with CKD. Johns Hopkins University, with expertise in nephrology, evidence synthesis, and guideline development, was contracted as theERT and was tasked with conducting the evidence reviews.The ERT coordinated the methodological and analyticalprocesses of guideline development, including literaturesearching, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, evidence synthesis and meta-analysis, grading the certainty of the evi- dence per critical outcome, and grading the overall certaintyof the evidence for the recommendations. The Work Groupwas responsible for writing the recommendations and theunderlying rationale, grading the strength of the recom-mendations, and developing practice points. De\ufb01ning scope and topics and formulating key clinical ques- tions. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was reviewed by the Co-Chairs to identify topics to be included in the 2024guideline. Scoping reviews of these topics were conducted bythe ERT to provide an overview of the available evidence baseand to identify existing relevant systematic reviews. The Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the existing reviews. Whenhigh-quality systematic reviews were identi \ufb01ed during the scoping reviews, the ERT conducted an updated search based on the existing review and extracted information from the newly identi \ufb01ed studies. This information was added to the existing review data and analyzed as appropriate. For topics that did not map to current high-quality re- views, de novo systematic reviews were undertaken. Protocols for each review were developed by the ERT and reviewed bythe Work Group. Protocols were registered on PROSPERO(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/ ). Systematic reviews were conducted in accordance with current standards,including those from the Cochrane Handbook. 919 Details of the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study design (PICOS) of the questions are pro-vided in Table 44 . 23,316,318,415,511,609,920\u2013926Information about existing reviews that were used is included in these tables. For some topics not prede \ufb01ned in the Scope of Work, the ERT extracted the certainty of evidence from existing high- quality systematic reviews, as available. Details of the", "PICOS for these questions are also provided in Table 44 . Literature searches and article selection. Searches for RCTs were conducted on PubMed, Embase, and the CochraneCentral Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), andsearches for diagnosis/prognosis studies were conducted onPubMed, Embase, and CINAHL. For topics with availableexisting reviews, the review was used and an updated search was conducted. The search strategies are provided in Appendix A :Supplementary Table S1 . To improve ef \ufb01ciency and accuracy in the title/abstract screening process and to manage the process, search resultswere uploaded to a web-based screening tool, PICO Portal(www.picoportal.net ).

For these reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool was used to assess risk of bias for RCTs based on the randomization process, deviations from the intended in-terventions, missing outcome data, measurement of theoutcome, and selection of the reported results. 927 The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess study limitations ofdiagnostic studies based on the following items 928: /C15Could the selection of patients have introduced bias (pa- tient selection)? /C15Could the conduct or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias (index test)? /C15Could the reference standard, its conduct, or its interpre-tation have introduced bias (reference standard)? /C15Could the patient \ufb02ow have introduced bias ( \ufb02ow and timing)? /C15Applicability /C15Are there concerns that the included patients and setting do not match the review question? /C15Are there concerns that the index test, its conduct, or interpretation differ from the review question? /C15Are there concerns that the target condition asde\ufb01ned by the reference standard does not match the question? The ROBIS tool was used to assess risk of bias in sys- tematic reviews based on study eligibility criteria, identi \ufb01ca- tion and selection of studies, data collection and studyappraisal, and overall risk of bias. 929All risk-of-bias assessments were conducted independently by 2 members of the ERT, with disagreements resolved byinternal discussion and consultation with a third ERT mem-ber, as needed. Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Measures of treatment effect. For dichotomous outcomes, a pooled effect estimate was calculated as the RR between the trial arms of RCTs, witheach study weighted by the inverse variance, using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian and Laird formula for calculating between-study variance. 930For continuous outcomes, a standardized mean difference was calculated by using a random-effects model with the DerSimonian andLaird formula. 930 Data synthesis. Meta-analysis was conducted if there were 2 or more studies that were suf \ufb01ciently similar with respect to key variables (population characteristics, study duration, andcomparisons).

Heterogeneity among the trials for each outcome was tested using a standard c2test using a signi\ufb01cance level of a#0.10. Heterogeneity was also assessed with an I2statistic, which describes the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than random chance. A value greater than 50% was considered to indicatesubstantial heterogeneity. 933 Grading the certainty of the evidence and the strength of a guideline recommendation. The certainty of evidence for each critical outcome was assessed by the ERT using the GRADEapproach. 934,935For outcomes based on data from RCTs, the initial grade for the certainty of the evidence is considered tobe high. The certainty of the evidence is lowered in the eventof study limitations; important inconsistencies in resultsacross studies; indirectness of the results, including uncertainty about the population, intervention, outcomes measured in trials, and their applicability to the clinicalquestion of interest; imprecision in the evidence reviewresults; and concerns about publication bias. Forimprecision, data were benchmarked against optimalinformation size, 936low event rates in either arm, CIs that indicate appreciable bene \ufb01t and harm (25% decrease and 25% increase in the outcome of interest), and sparse data (only 1 study), all indicating concerns about the precision of the results.936The \ufb01nal grade for the certainty of the evidence for an outcome could be high (A), moderate (B),low (C), or very low (D) ( Tables 45 and46).Summary of \ufb01ndings (SoF) tables. SoF tables were developed using GRADEpro (https://www.gradepro.org/ ). The SoF ta- bles include a description of the population, intervention, andcomparator and,", "where applicable, the results from the datasynthesis as relative and absolute effect estimates. The gradingof the certainty of the evidence for each critical outcome isalso provided in these tables. The SoF tables are available in Appendix C and Appendix D of the Data Supplement published alongside the guideline or at https://kdigo.org/ guidelines/ckd-evaluation-and-management/ . Updating and developing the guideline state- ments. Recommendations from the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease were considered in the context ofnew evidence by the Work Group Co-Chairs and Work Group members, and updated as appropriate. 1Practice points were not yet proposed as a separate category in 2012, so the KDIGO 2024 Work Group considered the followingoptions: where new evidence did not suggest a change tograded recommendations, the statements were retained asgraded recommendations; graded recommendations wereupdated where appropriate based on new evidence; existingrecommendations that \ufb01t the criteria for practice points were rewritten as practice points, and new guidelinestatements (both recommendations and practice points)were generated for new clinical questions from the 2024update.Table 45 | Classi \ufb01cation for certainty of evidence Grade Certainty of evidence Meaning A High We are con \ufb01dent that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect. B Moderate The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. C Low The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. D Very low The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often, it will be far from the true effect.

The strength of a recommendation was graded by the Work Group as Level 1o rL e v e l2( Table 47 ). The strength of a recommendation was determined by the balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms across all critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overallcertainty of the evidence, patient values and preferences, resource use and costs, and other considerations ( Table 48 ). Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms. The Work Group determined the anticipated net health bene \ufb01t on the basis of expected bene\ufb01ts and harms across all critical outcomes from the underlying evidence review. The overall certainty of the evidence. The", "overall certainty of the evidence for each recommendation is determined by the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes. In general, the overall certainty of evidence is dictated by the critical outcome with the lowest certainty of evidence.936This could be modi \ufb01ed based on the relative importance of each outcome to the population of interest. The overall certaintyof the evidence was graded high (A), moderate (B), low(C), or very low (D) ( Table 46 ). Patient values and preferences. The Work Group included 2 people living with CKD. These members \u2019unique perspectives and lived experience, in addition to the Work Group under-standing of patient preferences and priorities, informed de-cisions about the strength of the recommendations. Asystematic review of qualitative studies on patient prioritiesand preferences was not undertaken for this guideline. Resources and other costs. Healthcare and non \u2013healthcare resources, including all inputs in the treatment managementpathway, were considered in grading the strength of arecommendation. 937The following resources were considered: direct healthcare costs, non \u2013healthcare resources (such as transportation and social services), informalcaregiver resources (e.g., time of family and caregivers), andchanges in productivity. No formal economic evaluations,including cost-effectiveness analysis, were conducted. Practice points. In addition to graded recommendations, KDIGO guidelines now include \u201cpractice points \u201dto help healthcare providers better evaluate and implement the guid-ance from the expert Work Group. Practice points are consensus statements about a speci \ufb01c aspect of care and supplement rec- ommendations. These were developed when no formal sys- tematic evidence review was undertaken or there wasinsuf\ufb01cient evidence to provide a graded recommendation. Practice points represent the expert judgment of the guidelineWork Group, and they may be based on limited evidence.Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, a \ufb01gure, or an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice. Format for guideline recommendations. Each guideline recommendation provides an assessment of the strength ofthe recommendation (Level 1, \u201cwe recommend \u201dor Level 2, \u201cwe suggest \u201d) and the overall certainty of the evidence (A, B, C, D). The recommendation statements are followed by Keyinformation (Balance of bene \ufb01ts and harms, Certainty of the evidence, Values and preferences, Resource use and costs,Considerations for implementation), and Rationale. Each recommendation is linked to relevant SoF tables. An under- lying rationale may also support a practice point.Table 47 | KDIGO nomenclature and description for grading recommendations GradeImplications Patients Clinicians Policy Level 1 \u201cWe recommend\u201dMost people in your situation would wantthe recommended course of action, andonly a small proportion would not.Most patients should receive therecommended course of action.The recommendation can be evaluatedas a candidate for developing a policyor a performance measure.
